0,"Context: Abrasion is another type of mechanical weathering. With abrasion, one rock bumps against another rock. Gravity causes abrasion as a rock tumbles down a slope. Moving water causes abrasion it moves rocks so that they bump against one another (Figure 9.3). Strong winds cause abrasion by blasting sand against rock surfaces. Finally, the ice in glaciers cause abrasion. Pieces of rock embedded in ice at the bottom of a glacier scrape against the rock below. If you have ever collected beach glass or pebbles from a stream, you have witnessed the work of abrasion. 
Question: Gravity causes erosion by all of the following except
Options:(A) glaciers (B) moving air (C) flowing water (D) mass movement
Answer:",B
1,"Context: Erosion by gravity is called mass wasting. Mass wasting can be slow and virtually imperceptible, or rapid, massive, and deadly. Weathered material may fall away from a cliff because there is nothing to keep it in place. Rocks that fall to the base of a cliff make a talus slope. Sometimes as one rock falls, it hits another rock, which hits another rock, and begins a landslide.

4,"Context: Creep is the very slow movement of rock and soil down a hillside. Creep occurs so slowly you cant see it happening. You can only see the effects of creep after years of movement. This is illustrated in Figure 10.33. The slowly moving ground causes trees, fence posts, and other structures on the surface to tilt downhill. Creep usually takes place where the ground freezes and thaws frequently. Soil and rock particles are lifted up when the ground freezes. When the ground thaws, the particles settle down again. Each time they settle down, they move a tiny bit farther down the slope because of gravity.

23,"Context: Landslides cause $1 billion to $2 billion damage in the United States each year and are responsible for traumatic and sudden loss of life and homes in many areas of the world. Some at-risk communities have developed landslide warning systems. Around San Francisco Bay, the National Weather Service and the U.S. Geological Survey use rain gauges to monitor soil moisture. If soil becomes saturated, the weather service issues a warning. Earthquakes, which may occur on Californias abundant faults, can also trigger landslides. To be safe from landslides: Be aware of your surroundings and notice changes in the natural world. Look for cracks or bulges in hillsides, tilting of decks or patios, or leaning poles or fences when rainfall is heavy. Sticking windows and doors can indicate ground movement as soil pushes slowly against a house and knocks windows and doors out of alignment. Look for landslide scars because landslides are most likely to happen where they have occurred before. Plant vegetation and trees on the hillside around your home to help hold soil in place. Help to keep a slope stable by building retaining walls. Installing good drainage in a hillside may keep the soil from getting saturated. Hillside properties in the San Francisco Bay Area and elsewhere may be prone to damage from landslides. Geologists are studying the warning signs and progress of local landslides to help reduce risks and give people adequate warnings of these looming threats.

38,"Context: On May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy challenged the U.S. Congress: I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him back safely to the Earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish. The Soviets were also trying to reach the Moon. Who would win? The answer came eight years after Kennedys challenge, on July 20, 1969. NASAs Apollo 11 mission put astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the Moon, as shown in Figure 23.21. A total of five American missions put astronauts on the Moon. The last was Apollo 17.

41,"Context: Particulates reduce visibility. In the western United States, people can now ordinarily see only about 100 to 150 kilometers (60 to 90 miles), which is one-half to two-thirds the natural (pre-pollution) range on a clear day. In the East, people can only see about 40 to 60 kilometers (25-35 miles), about one-fifth the distance they could see without any air pollution (Figure 1.1). Particulates reduce the amount of sunshine that reaches the ground, which may reduce photosynthesis. Since particulates form the nucleus for raindrops, snowflakes, or other forms of precipitation, precipitation may increase Smog in New York City. when particulates are high. An increase in particles in the air seems to increase the number of raindrops, but often decreases their size. By reducing sunshine, particulates can also alter air temperature as mentioned above. Imagine how much all of the sources of particulates combine to reduce temperatures. What affect might this have on global warming?

Answer:",A
57,"Context: Density is mass per unit volume. Density is a measure of how closely molecules are packed together. The closer together they are, the greater the density. Since air is a gas, the molecules can pack tightly or spread out. The density of air varies from place to place. Air density depends on several factors. One is temperature. Like other materials, warm air is less dense than cool air. Since warmer molecules have more energy, they are more active. The molecules bounce off each other and spread apart. Another factor that affects the density of air is altitude. 
Question: The density of air depends on how closely gas molecules are packed together.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
58,"Context: Altitude is height above sea level. The density of air decreases with height. There are two reasons. At higher altitudes, there is less air pushing down from above. Also, gravity is weaker farther from Earths center. So at higher altitudes, air molecules can spread out more. Air density decreases. You can see this in Figure 15.4.

62,"Context: Because air is a gas, its molecules have a lot of energy. Air molecules move a lot and bump into things. For this reason, they exert pressure. Air pressure is defined as the weight of the air pressing against a given area. At sea level, the atmosphere presses down with a force of about 1 kilogram per square centimeter (14.76 pounds per square inch). If you are standing at sea level, you have more than a ton of air pressing against you. Why doesnt the pressure crush you? Air presses in all directions at once. Other molecules of air are pushing back. 
Question: weight of air pushing against a given area

Answer:",B
64,"Context: Earths first atmosphere was made of hydrogen and helium, the gases that were common in this region of the solar system as it was forming. Most of these gases were drawn into the center of the solar nebula to form the Sun. When Earth was new and very small, the solar wind blew off atmospheric gases that collected. If gases did collect, they were vaporized by impacts, especially from the impact that brought about the formation of the Moon. Eventually things started to settle down and gases began to collect. High heat in Earths early days meant that there were constant volcanic eruptions, which released gases from the mantle into the atmosphere (see opening image). Just as today, volcanic outgassing was a source of water vapor, carbon dioxide, small amounts of nitrogen, and other gases. Scientists have calculated that the amount of gas that collected to form the early atmosphere could not have come entirely from volcanic eruptions. Frequent impacts by asteroids and comets brought in gases and ices, including water, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia, nitrogen, and other volatiles from elsewhere in the solar system (Figure Calculations also show that asteroids and comets cannot be responsible for all of the gases of the early atmosphere, so both impacts and outgassing were needed.

65,"Context: The energy of a mechanical wave can travel only through matter. This matter is called the medium (plural, media). The medium in Figure 19.1 is a liquid the water in the pond. But the medium of a mechanical wave can be any state of matter, including a solid or a gas. Its important to note that particles of matter in the medium dont actually travel along with the wave. Only the energy travels. The particles of the medium just vibrate, or move back-and- forth or up-and-down in one spot, always returning to their original positions. As the particles vibrate, they pass the energy of the disturbance to the particles next to them, which pass the energy to the particles next to them, and so on.

66,"Context: Clouds are classified on the basis of where and how they form. Three main types of clouds are cirrus, stratus, and cumulus. Figure 16.3 shows these and other types of clouds. Cirrus clouds form high in the troposphere. Because it is so cold they are made of ice crystals. They are thin and wispy. Cirrus clouds dont usually produce precipitation, but they may be a sign that wet weather is coming. Stratus clouds occur low in the troposphere. They form in layers that spread horizontally and may cover the entire sky like a thick blanket. Stratus clouds that produce precipitation are called nimbostratus. The prefix nimbo- means rain. Cumulus clouds are white and puffy. Convection currents make them grow upward and they may grow very tall. When they produce rain, they are called cumulonimbus.

69,"Context: When air is very humid, it doesnt have to cool very much for water vapor in the air to start condensing. The temperature at which condensation occurs is called the dew point. The dew point varies depending on air temperature and moisture content. It is always less than or equal to the actual air temperature, but warmer air and moister air have dew points closer to the actual air temperature. Thats why glasses of cold drinks sweat more on a hot, humid day than they do on a cool, dry day. Q: What happens when air temperature reaches the dew point? A: When air temperature reaches the dew point, water vapor starts condensing. It may form dew (as on the spider web in the opening image), clouds, or fog. Dew forms on solid objects on the ground. Clouds form on tiny particles in the air high above the ground. Fog is a cloud that forms on tiny particles in the air close to the ground. 
Question: temperature at which water vapor condenses out of the air

70,"Context: The most common precipitation comes from clouds. Rain or snow droplets grow as they ride air currents in a cloud and collect other droplets (Figure 1.2). They fall when they become heavy enough to escape from the rising air currents that hold them up in the cloud. One million cloud droplets will combine to make only one rain drop! If temperatures are cold, the droplet will hit the ground as snow. (a) Dew on a flower. (b) Hoar frost. (a) Rain falls from clouds when the temperature is fairly warm. (b) Snow storm in Helsinki, Finland. Other less common types of precipitation are sleet (Figure 1.3). Sleet is rain that becomes ice as it hits a layer of freezing air near the ground. If a frigid raindrop freezes on the frigid ground, it forms glaze. Hail forms in cumulonimbus clouds with strong updrafts. An ice particle travels until it finally becomes too heavy and it drops.

73,"Context: Weather occurs because of unequal heating of the atmosphere. The source of heat is the Sun. The general principles behind weather can be stated simply: The Sun heats Earths surface more in some places than others. Where it is warm, heat from the Sun warms the air close to the surface. If there is water at the surface, it may cause some of the water to evaporate. Warm air is less dense, so it rises. When this happens, more dense air flows in to take its place. The flowing surface air is wind. The rising air cools as it goes higher in the atmosphere. If it is moist, the water vapor may condense. Clouds may form, and precipitation may fall. 
Question: Weather occurs because of unequal heating of the atmosphere.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
74,"Context: The water cycle plays an important role in weather. When liquid water evaporates, it causes humidity. When water vapor condenses, it forms clouds and precipitation. Humidity, clouds, and precipitation are all important weather factors.

Answer:",A
75,"Context: Air movement takes place in the troposphere. This is the lowest layer of the atmosphere. Air moves because of differences in heating. These differences create convection currents and winds. Figure 15.19 shows how this happens. Air in the troposphere is warmer near the ground. The warm air rises because it is light. The light, rising air creates an area of low air pressure at the surface. The rising air cools as it reaches the top of the troposphere. The air gets denser, so it sinks to the surface. The sinking, heavy air creates an area of high air pressure near the ground. Air always flows from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. Air flowing over Earths surface is called wind. The greater the difference in pressure, the stronger the wind blows. 
Question: Warm air always sinks toward Earths surface.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
76,"Context: Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. High humidity increases the chances of clouds and precipitation. 
Question: If the relative humidity is 100 percent, it must be raining.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
77,"Context: As temperatures increase, warm, moist air rises. These updrafts first form cumulus and then cumulonimbus clouds. Winds at the top of the troposphere blow the cloud top sideways to make the anvil shape that characterizes a cloud as a thunderhead. As water vapor condenses to form a cloud, the latent heat makes the air in the cloud warmer than the air outside the cloud. Water droplets and ice fly up through the cloud in updrafts. When these droplets get heavy enough, they fall. A mature thunderstorm with updrafts and downdrafts that reach the ground. This starts a downdraft, and soon there is a convection cell within the cloud. The cloud grows into a cumulonimbus 
Question: Cumulus clouds may grow very tall because of high air pressure.

Question: Stratus clouds are clouds that form in the stratosphere.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
79,"Context: Clouds are classified in several ways. The most common classification used today divides clouds into four separate cloud groups, which are determined by their altitude (Figure 1.2). The four cloud types and where they are found in the atmosphere. High clouds form from ice crystals where the air is extremely cold and can hold little water vapor. Cirrus, cirrostratus, and cirrocumulus are all names of high clouds. Middle clouds, including altocumulus and altostratus clouds, may be made of water droplets, ice crystals or both, depending on the air temperatures. Thick and broad altostratus clouds are gray or blue-gray. They often cover the entire sky and usually mean a large storm, bearing a lot of precipitation, is coming. Low clouds are nearly all water droplets. Stratus, stratocumulus, and nimbostratus clouds are common low clouds. Nimbostratus clouds are thick and dark. They bring steady rain or snow. Vertical clouds, clouds with the prefix ""cumulo-,"" grow vertically instead of horizontally and have their bases at low altitude and their tops at high or middle altitude. Clouds grow vertically when strong air currents are rising upward. Precipitating clouds are nimbus clouds. 
Question: Altostratus clouds form higher in the atmosphere than stratus clouds.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
80,"Context: Millions of water molecules in a cloud must condense to make a single raindrop or snowflake. The drop or flake falls when it becomes too heavy for updrafts to keep it aloft. As a drop or flake falls, it may collect more water and get larger. 
Question: A single raindrop consists of millions of water molecules.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
81,"Context: Why does it snow instead of rain? Air temperature determines which type of precipitation falls. Rain falls if the air temperature is above freezing (0 C or 32 F). Frozen precipitation falls if the air or ground is below freezing. Frozen precipitation may fall as snow, sleet, or freezing rain. You can see how the different types form in Figure Snow falls when water vapor condenses as ice crystals. The air temperature is below freezing all the way to the ground, so the ice crystals remain frozen. They fall as flakes. Sleet forms when snow melts as it falls through a layer of warm air and then refreezes. It turns into small, clear ice pellets as it passes through a cold layer near the ground. Freezing rain falls as liquid water. It freezes on contact with cold surfaces near the ground. It may cover everything with a glaze of ice. If the ice is thick, its weight may break tree branches and pull down power lines. Hail is another

88,"Context: Rising air currents carry water vapor into the atmosphere. As the water vapor rises in the atmosphere, it cools and condenses. Condensation is the process in which water vapor changes to tiny droplets of liquid water. The water droplets may form clouds. If the droplets get big enough, they fall as precipitation. Precipitation is any form of water that falls from the atmosphere. It includes rain, snow, sleet, hail, and freezing rain. Most precipitation falls into the ocean. Eventually, this water evaporates again and repeats the water cycle. Some frozen precipitation becomes part of ice caps and glaciers. These masses of ice can store frozen water for hundreds of years or even longer. Condensation may also form fog or dew. Some living things, like the lizard in Figure 24.8, depend directly on these sources of liquid water.

100,"Context: There are many ways to protect soil. We can add organic material like manure or compost. This increases the soils fertility. Increased fertility improves the soils ability to hold water and nutrients. Inorganic fertilizers also increase fertility. These fertilizers are less expensive than natural fertilizers, but they do not provide the same long term benefits. Careful farming helps to keep up soil quality each season. One way is to plant different crops each year. Another is to alternate the crops planted in each row of the field. These techniques preserve and replenish soil nutrients. Planting nutrient rich cover crops helps the soil. Planting trees as windbreaks, plowing along contours of a field, or building terraces into steeper slopes all help to hold soil in place (Figure 9.14). No-till or low-till farming disturbs the ground as little as possible during planting. 
Question: plants that hold soil in place between growing seasons

Plowing turns over bare soil and cuts through plant roots. Bare soil is exposed to wind and water. In the past, farmers always plowed fields before planting. Some farmers now use no-till farming, which does not disturb the soil as much. The problem doesnt stop with plowing. Crops are usually planted in rows, with bare soil in between the rows. In places where crops grow only during part of the year, the land may be bare for a few months. 
Question: cutting through plant roots and turning over soil before planting
Options:(A) contour cropping (B) strip cropping (C) cover crop (D) windbreak (E) no-till planting (F) plowing (G) terracing
Answer:",F
106,"Context: There are several other ways to help prevent soil loss. Some of them are shown in Figure 19.7. Prevent overgrazing. Frequently move animals from field to field. This gives the grass a chance to recover. Avoid logging steep hillsides. Cut only a few trees in any given place. Plant new trees to replace those that are cut down. Reclaim mine lands. Save the stripped topsoil and return it to the land. Once the soil is in place, plant trees and other plants to protect the bare soil. Use barriers to prevent runoff and soil erosion at construction sites. Plant grass to hold the soil in place. Develop paving materials that absorb water and reduce runoff. Restrict the use of off-road vehicles, especially in hilly areas.

107,"Context: The Dust Bowl taught people that soil could be lost by plowing and growing crops. This led to the development of new ways of farming that help protect the soil. Some of the methods are described in Figure 19.6. 
Question: Factors that contributed to the Dust Bowl included
Options:(A) plowing the land (B) lack of rain (C) high winds (D) all of the above
Answer:",D
108,"Context: Life as we know it would not be possible without plants. Why are plants so important? Plants supply food to nearly all land organisms, including people. We mainly eat either plants or other living things that eat plants. Plants produce oxygen during photosynthesis. Oxygen is needed by all aerobic organisms. Plants absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. This helps control the greenhouse effect and global warming. Plants recycle matter in ecosystems. For example, they are an important part of the water cycle. They take up liquid water from the soil through their roots. They release water vapor to the air from their leaves. This is called transpiration. Plants provide many products for human use. They include timber, medicines, dyes, oils, and rubber. Plants provide homes for many other living things. For example, a single tree may provide food and shelter to many species of animals, like the birds in Figure 10.2. 
Question: Plants need soil to
Options:(A) obtain carbon dioxide (B) anchor their roots (C) prevent runoff (D) all of the above
Answer:",B
109,"Context: The agents of soil erosion are the same as the agents of all types of erosion: water, wind, ice, or gravity. Running water is the leading cause of soil erosion, because water is abundant and has a lot of power. Wind is also a leading cause of soil erosion because wind can pick up soil and blow it far away. Activities that remove vegetation, disturb the ground, or allow the ground to dry are activities that increase erosion. What are some human activities that increase the likelihood that soil will be eroded? 
Question: The main cause of soil erosion is
Options:(A) wind (B) abrasion (C) ice wedging (D) running water

111,"Context: As you can see in Figure 19.3, some grazing animals, especially sheep and goats, eat grass right down to the roots. They may even pull the grass entirely out of the ground. Grazing animals can kill the grass or thin it out so much that it offers little protection to the soil. If animals are kept in the same place too long, the soil may become completely bare. The bare soil is easily eroded by wind and water. 
Question: Grazing animals that are likely to leave the soil bare include
Options:(A) cattle (B) sheep (C) goats (D) two of the above
Answer:",D
112,"Context: Other human actions that put soil at risk include logging, mining, and construction. You can see examples of each in Figure 19.4. When forests are cut down, the soil is suddenly exposed to wind and rain. Without trees, there is no leaf litter to cover the ground and protect the soil. When leaf litter decays, it adds humus and nutrients to the soil. Mining and construction strip soil off the ground and leave the land bare. Paved roads and parking lots prevent rainwater from soaking into the ground. This increases runoff and the potential for soil erosion. 
Question: Human actions that increase the risk of soil loss include
Options:(A) logging (B) terracing (C) tree planting (D) no till planting

115,"Context: The Boxing Day Tsunami struck on December 26, 2004. This tsunami was by far the deadliest of all time (Figure registered magnitude 9.1. The quake struck near Sumatra, Indonesia, where the Indian plate is subducting beneath the Burma plate. It released about 550 million times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Several tsunami waves were created. The tsunami struck eight countries around the Indian Ocean (Figure 7.31). About 230,000 people died. More than 1.2 million people lost their homes. Many more lost their way of making a living. Fishermen lost their boats, and businesspeople lost their restaurants and shops. Many marine animals washed onshore, including dolphins, turtles, and sharks.

116,"Context: As a result of the 2004 tsunami, an Indian Ocean warning system was put into operation in June 2006. Prior to 2004, no one had thought a large tsunami was possible in the Indian Ocean. In comparison, a warning system has been in effect around the Pacific Ocean for more than 50 years. The system was used to warn of possible tsunami waves after the Tohoku earthquake, but most were too close to the quake to get to high ground in time. Further away, people were evacuated along many Pacific coastlines, but the waves were not that large. 
Question: the tsunami went around the indian ocean over the course of about one hour.

117,"Context: Not everyone had the same warning the people on Tillys beach had. The Boxing Day Tsunami of December 26, 2004 was by far the deadliest of all time (Figure 1.1). The tsunami was caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake. With a magnitude of 9.2, it was the second largest earthquake ever recorded. The extreme movement of the crust displaced trillions of tons of water along the entire length of the rupture. Several tsunami waves were created with about 30 minutes between the peaks of each one. The waves that struck nearby Sumatra 15 minutes after the quake reached more than 10 meters (33 feet) in height. The size of the waves decreased with distance from the earthquake and were about 4 meters (13 feet) high in Somalia. The tsunami did so much damage because it traveled throughout the Indian Ocean. About 230,000 people died in eight countries. There were fatalities even as far away as South Africa, nearly 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) from the earthquake epicenter. More than 1.2 million people lost their homes and many more lost their ways of making a living. The countries that were most affected by the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami.

119,"Context: Like other waves, a tsunami wave has a crest and a trough. When the wave hits the beach, the crest or the trough may come ashore first. When the trough comes in first, water is sucked out to sea. The seafloor just offshore from the beach is exposed. Curious people often walk out onto the beach to see the unusual sight. They drown when the wave crest hits. One amazing story from the Indian Ocean tsunami is that of Tilly Smith. Tilly was a 10-year-old British girl who was visiting Maikhao Beach in Thailand with her parents. Tilly had learned about tsunami in school two weeks before the earthquake. She knew that the receding water and the frothy bubbles at the sea surface meant a tsunami was coming. Tilly told her parents, who told other tourists and the staff at their hotel. The beach was evacuated and no one on Maikhao Beach died. Tilly is credited with saving nearly 100 people! 
Question: tilly smith saved about 100 people on a beach in thailand because she

120,"Context: The Japanese received a one-two punch in March 2011. The 2011 Tohoku earthquake offshore was a magnitude 9.0 and damage from the quake was extensive. People didnt have time to recover before massive tsunami waves hit the island nation. As seen in Figure 1.2, waves in some regions topped 9 meters (27 feet). The tsunami did much more damage than the massive earthquake (Figure 1.3). Worst was the damage done to nuclear power plants along the northeastern coast. Eleven reactors were automatically shut down. Power and backup power were lost at the Fukushima plant, leading to equipment failures, meltdowns, and the release of radioactive materials. Control and cleanup of the disabled plants will go on for many years.

123,"Context: Most of the Indian Ocean tragedy could have been avoided if a warning system had been in place(Figure 7.32). As of June 2006, the Indian Ocean now has a warning system. Since tsunami are much more common in the Pacific, communities around the Pacific have had a tsunami warning system since 1948. Warning systems arent always helpful. People in communities very close to the earthquake do not have enough time to move inland or uphill. Farther away from the quake, evacuation of low-lying areas saves lives. 
Question: why didnt the tsunami warning system in the pacific ocean save more lives in the japan tsunami of 2011?
Options:(A) The people heard the warning but thought it was a false alarm (B) There was nowhere to go once the people heard the warning (C) The quake was so close that there wasn’t time to get to high ground once the warning (D) The quake was too small to activate the warning system and so the tsunami was unexpected

124,"Context: Hubble measured the distances to galaxies. He also studied the motions of galaxies. In doing these things, Hubble noticed a relationship. This is now called Hubbles Law: The farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from us. There was only one conclusion he could draw from this. The universe is expanding! Figure 26.15 shows a simple diagram of the expanding universe. Imagine a balloon covered with tiny dots. When you blow up the balloon, the rubber stretches. The dots slowly move away from each other as the space between them increases. In an expanding universe, the space between galaxies is expanding. We see this as the other galaxies moving away from us. We also see that galaxies farther away from us move away faster than nearby galaxies.

Answer:",C
125,"Context: The things we observe in space are objects that emit some type of electromagnetic radiation. However, scientists think that matter that emits light makes up only a small part of the matter in the universe. The rest of the matter, about 80%, is dark matter. Dark matter emits no electromagnetic radiation, so we cant observe it directly. However, astronomers know that dark matter exists because its gravity affects the motion of objects around it. When astronomers measure how spiral galaxies rotate, they find that the outside edges of a galaxy rotate at the same speed as parts closer to the center. This can only be explained if there is a lot more matter in the galaxy than they can see. Gravitational lensing occurs when light is bent from a very distant bright source around a super-massive object (Figure 1.1). To explain strong gravitational lensing, more matter than is observed must be present. With so little to go on, astronomers dont really know much about the nature of dark matter. One possibility is that it could just be ordinary matter that does not emit radiation in objects such as black holes, neutron stars, and brown dwarfs  objects larger than Jupiter but smaller than the smallest stars. But astronomers cannot find enough of these types of objects, which they have named MACHOs (massive astrophyiscal compact halo object), to account for all the dark matter, so they are thought to be only a small part of the total. Another possibility is that the dark matter is very different from the ordinary matter we see. Some appear to be particles that have gravity, but dont otherwise appear to interact with other particles. Scientists call these theoretical particles WIMPs, which stands for Weakly Interactive Massive Particles. Most scientists who study dark matter think that the dark matter in the universe is a combination of MACHOs and some type of exotic matter, such as WIMPs. Researching dark matter is an active area of scientific research, and astronomers knowledge about dark matter is changing rapidly.

127,"Context: If you look at a star through a prism, you will see a spectrum, or a range of colors through the rainbow. The spectrum will have specific dark bands where elements in the star absorb light of certain energies. By examining the arrangement of these dark absorption lines, astronomers can determine the composition of elements that make up a distant star. In fact, the element helium was first discovered in our Sun  not on Earth  by analyzing the absorption lines in the spectrum of the Sun. While studying the spectrum of light from distant galaxies, astronomers noticed something strange. The dark lines in the spectrum were in the patterns they expected, but they were shifted toward the red end of the spectrum, as shown in Figure 1.1. This shift of absorption bands toward the red end of the spectrum is known as redshift. Redshift is a shift in absorption bands toward the red end of the spectrum. What could make the absorption bands of a star shift toward the red? Redshift occurs when the light source is moving away from the observer or when the space between the observer and the source is stretched. What does it mean that stars and galaxies are redshifted? When astronomers see redshift in the light from a galaxy, they know that the galaxy is moving away from Earth. If galaxies were moving randomly, would some be redshifted but others be blueshifted? Of course. Since almost every galaxy in the universe has a redshift, almost every galaxy is moving away from Earth. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:

128,"Context: Although it is difficult to know what the shape of the Milky Way Galaxy is because we are inside of it, astronomers have identified it as a typical spiral galaxy containing about 200 billion to 400 billion stars (Figure 1.1). An artists rendition of what astronomers think the Milky Way Galaxy would look like seen from above. The Sun is located approximately where the arrow points. Like other spiral galaxies, our galaxy has a disk, a central bulge, and spiral arms. The disk is about 100,000 light- years across and 3,000 light-years thick. Most of the Galaxys gas, dust, young stars, and open clusters are in the disk. What evidence do astronomers find that lets them know that the Milky Way is a spiral galaxy? 1. The shape of the galaxy as we see it (Figure 1.2). 2. The velocities of stars and gas in the galaxy show a rotational motion. 3. The gases, color, and dust are typical of spiral galaxies. The central bulge is about 12,000 to 16,000 light-years wide and 6,000 to 10,000 light-years thick. The central bulge contains mostly older stars and globular clusters. Some recent evidence suggests the bulge might not be spherical, but is instead shaped like a bar. The bar might be as long as 27,000 light-years long. The disk and bulge are surrounded by a faint, spherical halo, which also contains old stars and globular clusters. Astronomers have discovered that there is a gigantic black hole at the center of the galaxy. The Milky Way Galaxy is a big place.

There might just be a lot of black holes. Another possibility is that the universe contains a lot of matter that is different from anything we know. If it doesnt interact much with ordinary matter, it would be very difficult or impossible to detect directly. Most scientists who study dark matter think it is a combination. Ordinary matter is part of it. That is mixed with some kind of matter that we havent discovered yet. Most scientists think that ordinary matter is less than half of the total matter in the universe.

140,"Context: Timeline of the Big Bang and the expan- sion of the Universe. The Big Bang theory is the most widely accepted cosmological explanation of how the universe formed. If we start at the present and go back into the past, the universe is contracting  getting smaller and smaller. What is the end result of a contracting universe? According to the Big Bang theory, the universe began about 13.7 billion years ago. Everything that is now in the universe was squeezed into a very small volume. Imagine all of the known universe in a single, hot, chaotic mass. An enormous explosion  a big bang  caused the universe to start expanding rapidly. All the matter and energy in the universe, and even space itself, came out of this explosion. What came before the Big Bang? There is no way for scientists to know since there is no remaining evidence.

143,"Context: Hubble measured the distances to galaxies. He also studied the motions of galaxies. In doing these things, Hubble noticed a relationship. This is now called Hubbles Law: The farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from us. There was only one conclusion he could draw from this. The universe is expanding! Figure 26.15 shows a simple diagram of the expanding universe. Imagine a balloon covered with tiny dots. When you blow up the balloon, the rubber stretches. The dots slowly move away from each other as the space between them increases. In an expanding universe, the space between galaxies is expanding. We see this as the other galaxies moving away from us. We also see that galaxies farther away from us move away faster than nearby galaxies.

Answer:",A
146,"Context: The Big Bang Theory is the dominant and highly supported theory of the origin of the universe. It states that the universe began from an initial point which has expanded over billions of years to form the universe as we now know it. In 1922, Alexander Friedman found that the solutions to Einsteins general relativity equations resulted in an expanding universe. Einstein, at that time, believed in a static, eternal universe so he added a constant to his equations to eliminate the expansion. Einstein would later call this the biggest blunder of his life. In 1924, Edwin Hubble was able to measure the distance to observed celestial objects that were thought to be nebula and discovered that they were so far away they were not actually part of the Milky Way (the galaxy containing our sun). He discovered that the Milky Way was only one of many galaxies. In 1927, Georges Lemaitre, a physicist, suggested that the universe must be expanding. Lemaitres theory was supported by Hubble in 1929 when he found that the galaxies most distant from us also had the greatest red shift (were moving away from us with the greatest speed). The idea that the most distance galaxies were moving away from us at the greatest speed was exactly what was predicted by Lemaitre. In 1931, Lemaitre went further with his predictions and by extrapolating backwards, found that the matter of the universe would reach an infinite density and temperature at a finite time in the past (around 15 billion years). This meant that the universe must have begun as a small, extremely dense point of matter. At the time, the only other theory that competed with Lemaitres theory was the Steady State Theory of Fred Hoyle. The steady state theory predicted that new matter was created which made it appear that the universe was expanding but that the universe was constant. It was Hoyle who coined the term Big Bang Theory which he used as a derisive name for Lemaitres theory. George Gamow (1904 - 1968) was the major advocate of the Big Bang theory. He predicted that cosmic microwave background radiation should exist throughout the universe as a remnant of the Big Bang. As atoms formed from sub-atomic particles shortly after the Big Bang, electromagnetic radiation would be emitted and this radiation would still be observable today. Gamow predicted that the expansion of the universe would cool the original radiation so that now the radiation would be in the microwave range. The debate continued until 1965 when two Bell Telephone scientists stumbled upon the microwave radiation with their radio telescope.

149,"Context: We see many objects out in space that emit light. This matter is contained in stars, and the stars are contained in galaxies. Scientists think that stars and galaxies make up only a small part of the matter in the universe. The rest of the matter is called dark matter. Dark matter doesnt emit light, so we cant see it. We know it is there because it affects the motion of objects around it. For example, astronomers measure how spiral galaxies rotate. The outside edges of a galaxy rotate at the same speed as parts closer to the center. This can only be explained if there is a lot more matter in the galaxy than we can see. What is dark matter?

Question: Scientists recently discovered that the universe
Options:(A) has started to contract in size (B) is expanding even faster than before (C) is no longer expanding or contracting (D) will soon go through another big bang
Answer:",B
151,"Context: We know that the universe is expanding. Astronomers have wondered if it is expanding fast enough to escape the pull of gravity. Would the universe just expand forever? If it could not escape the pull of gravity, would it someday start to contract? This means it would eventually get squeezed together in a big crunch. This is the opposite of the Big Bang. Scientists may now have an answer. Recently, astronomers have discovered that the universe is expanding even faster than before. What is causing the expansion to accelerate? One hypothesis is that there is energy out in the universe that we cant see. Astronomers call this dark energy. We know even less about dark energy than we know about dark matter. Some scientists think that dark energy makes up more than half of the universe.

154,"Context: Atoms cannot only gain extra electrons. They can also lose electrons. In either case, they become ions. Ions are atoms that have a positive or negative charge because they have unequal numbers of protons and electrons. If atoms lose electrons, they become positive ions, or cations. If atoms gain electrons, they become negative ions, or anions. Consider the example of fluorine (see Figure 1.1). A fluorine atom has nine protons and nine electrons, so it is electrically neutral. If a fluorine atom gains an electron, it becomes a fluoride ion with an electric charge of -1.

They are commonly represented by models, like the one Figure 2.6. An atom has a central nucleus that is positive in charge. The nucleus is surrounded by negatively charged particles called electrons. The smallest particle of a compound that still has the properties of that compound is a molecule. A molecule consists of two or more atoms. For example, a molecule of water consists of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. Thats why the chemical formula for water is H2 O.

166,"Context: There are a multitude of laboratory and field techniques for identifying minerals. While a mineralogist might use a high-powered microscope to identify some minerals, or even techniques like x-ray diffraction, most are recognizable using physical properties. The most common field techniques put the observer in the shoes of a detective, whose goal it is to determine, by process of elimination, what the mineral in question is. The process of elimination usually includes observing things like color, hardness, smell, solubility in acid, streak, striations and/or cleavage. Check out the mineral in the opening image. What is the minerals color? What is its shape? Are the individual crystals shiny or dull? Are there lines (striations) running across the minerals? In this concept, the properties used to identify minerals are described in more detail. 
Question: Scientists use the physical properties of minerals to identify them.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
167,"Context: Minerals must be solid. For example, ice and water have the same chemical composition. Ice is a solid, so it is a mineral. Water is a liquid, so it is not a mineral. Some solids are not crystals. Glass, or the rock obsidian, are solid but not crystals. In a crystal, the atoms are arranged in a pattern. This pattern is regular and it repeats. Figure 3.3 shows how the atoms are arranged in halite (table salt). Halite contains atoms of sodium and chlorine in a pattern. Notice that the pattern goes in all three dimensions. The pattern of atoms in all halite is the same. Think about all of the grains of salt that are in a salt shaker. The atoms are arranged in the same way in every piece of salt. Sometimes two different minerals have the same chemical composition. But they are different minerals because they have different crystal structures. Diamonds are beautiful gemstones because they are very pretty and very hard. Graphite is the lead in pencils. Its not hard at all! Amazingly, both are made just of carbon. Compare the diamond with the pencil lead in Figure 3.4. Why are they so different? The carbon atoms in graphite bond to form layers. The bonds between each layer are weak. The carbon sheets can just slip past each other. The carbon atoms in diamonds bond together in all three directions. This strong network makes diamonds very hard.

182,"Context: Color is probably the easiest property to observe. Unfortunately, you can rarely identify a mineral only by its color. Sometimes, different minerals are the same color. For example, you might find a mineral that is a gold color, and so think it is gold. But it might actually be pyrite, or fools gold, which is made of iron and sulfide. It contains no gold atoms. A certain mineral may form in different colors. Figure 3.11 shows four samples of quartz, including one that is colorless and one that is purple. The purple color comes from a tiny amount of iron. The iron in quartz is a chemical impurity. Iron is not normally found in quartz. Many minerals are colored by chemical impurities. Other factors can also affect a minerals color. Weathering changes the surface of a mineral. Because color alone is unreliable, geologists rarely identify a mineral just on its color. To identify most minerals, they use several properties.

It allows an object to be matched with other objects of known mass. SI units for mass are the kilogram, but for smaller masses grams are often used instead. 
Question: amount of mass per unit volume of a substance
Options:(A) cleavage (B) fluorescence (C) density (D) fracture (E) hardness (F) luster (G) streak
Answer:",C
187,"Context: The density of matter is actually the amount of matter in a given space. The amount of matter is measured by its mass. The space matter takes up is measured by its volume. Therefore, the density of matter can be calculated with this formula: Density = mass volume Assume, for example, that a book has a mass of 500 g and a volume of 1000 cm3 . Then the density of the book is: Density = 500 g = 0.5 g/cm3 1000 cm3 Q: What is the density of a liquid that has a volume of 30 mL and a mass of 300 g? A: The density of the liquid is: Density = 300 g = 10 g/mL 30 mL 
Question: If the volume of a mineral is 6 and the mass is 3, what is its density?
Options:(A) 6 (B) 3 (C) 2 (D) 5
Answer:",D
188,"Context: Breaking a mineral breaks its chemical bonds. Since some bonds are weaker than other bonds, each type of mineral is likely to break where the bonds between the atoms are weaker. For that reason, minerals break apart in characteristic ways. Cleavage is the tendency of a mineral to break along certain planes to make smooth surfaces. Halite (Figure 1.3) breaks between layers of sodium and chlorine to form cubes with smooth surfaces. Mica has cleavage in one direction and forms sheets (Figure 1.4). Minerals can cleave into polygons. Magnetite forms octahedrons (Figure 1.5). One reason gemstones are beautiful is that the cleavage planes make an attractive crystal shape with smooth faces. Fracture is a break in a mineral that is not along a cleavage plane. Fracture is not always the same in the same mineral because fracture is not determined by the structure of the mineral. Minerals may have characteristic fractures (Figure 1.6). Metals usually fracture into jagged edges. If a mineral splinters like wood, it may be fibrous. Some minerals, such as quartz, form smooth curved surfaces when they fracture. Sheets of mica. 
Question: how a mineral breaks when it does not break along a plane
Options:(A) cleavage (B) fluorescence (C) density (D) fracture (E) hardness (F) luster (G) streak
Answer:",D
189,"Context: Streak is the color of the powder of a mineral. To do a streak test, you scrape the mineral across an unglazed porcelain plate. The plate is harder than many minerals, causing the minerals to leave a streak of powder on the plate. The color of the streak often differs from the color of the larger mineral sample, as Figure 3.12 shows. Streak is more reliable than color to identify minerals. The color of a mineral may vary. Streak does not vary. Also, different minerals may be the same color, but they may have a different color streak. For example, samples of hematite and galena can both be dark gray. They can be told apart because hematite has a red streak and galena has a gray streak. 
Question: The streak of a mineral is
Options:(A) the same as the color of the mineral (B) never the same color of the mineral (C) the same even when the same mineral is found in various colors (D) either black or white

193,"Context: Cleavage is the tendency of a mineral to break along certain planes. When a mineral breaks along a plane it makes a smooth surface. Minerals with different crystal structures will break or cleave in different ways, as in Figure 3.14. Halite tends to form cubes with smooth surfaces. Mica tends to form sheets. Fluorite can form octahedrons. Minerals can form various shapes. Polygons are shown in Figure 3.15. The shapes form as the minerals are broken along their cleavage planes. Cleavage planes determine how the crystals can be cut to make smooth surfaces. People who cut gemstones follow cleavage planes. Diamonds and emeralds can be cut to make beautiful gemstones.

194,"Context: Hardness is a minerals ability to resist being scratched. Minerals that are not easily scratched are hard. You test the hardness of a mineral by scratching its surface with a mineral of a known hardness. Mineralogists use the Mohs Hardness Scale, shown in Table 3.2, as a reference for mineral hardness. The scale lists common minerals in order of their relative hardness. You can use the minerals in the scale to test the hardness of an unknown mineral.

197,"Context: Luster describes the reflection of light off a minerals surface. Mineralogists have special terms to describe luster. One simple way to classify luster is based on whether the mineral is metallic or non-metallic. Minerals that are opaque and shiny, such as pyrite, have a metallic luster. Minerals such as quartz have a non-metallic luster. Different types of non-metallic luster are described in Table 1.1.

198,"Context: The patterns of atoms that make a mineral affect its physical properties. A minerals crystal shape is determined by the way the atoms are arranged. For example, you can see how atoms are arranged in halite in Figure 3.3. You can see how salt crystals look under a microscope in Figure 3.5. Salt crystals are all cubes whether theyre small or large. Other physical properties help scientists identify different minerals. They include: Color: the color of the mineral. Streak: the color of the minerals powder. Luster: the way light reflects off the minerals surface. Specific gravity: how heavy the mineral is relative to the same volume of water. Cleavage: the minerals tendency to break along flat surfaces. Fracture: the pattern in which a mineral breaks. Hardness: what minerals it can scratch and what minerals can scratch it.

199,"Context: Color is probably the easiest property to observe. Unfortunately, you can rarely identify a mineral only by its color. Sometimes, different minerals are the same color. For example, you might find a mineral that is a gold color, and so think it is gold. But it might actually be pyrite, or fools gold, which is made of iron and sulfide. It contains no gold atoms. A certain mineral may form in different colors. Figure 3.11 shows four samples of quartz, including one that is colorless and one that is purple. The purple color comes from a tiny amount of iron. The iron in quartz is a chemical impurity. Iron is not normally found in quartz. Many minerals are colored by chemical impurities. Other factors can also affect a minerals color. Weathering changes the surface of a mineral. Because color alone is unreliable, geologists rarely identify a mineral just on its color. To identify most minerals, they use several properties.

202,"Context: There are a multitude of laboratory and field techniques for identifying minerals. While a mineralogist might use a high-powered microscope to identify some minerals, or even techniques like x-ray diffraction, most are recognizable using physical properties. The most common field techniques put the observer in the shoes of a detective, whose goal it is to determine, by process of elimination, what the mineral in question is. The process of elimination usually includes observing things like color, hardness, smell, solubility in acid, streak, striations and/or cleavage. Check out the mineral in the opening image. What is the minerals color? What is its shape? Are the individual crystals shiny or dull? Are there lines (striations) running across the minerals? In this concept, the properties used to identify minerals are described in more detail.

203,"Context: You are going to visit a friend. You fill one backpack with books so you can study later. You stuff your pillow into another backpack that is the same size. Which backpack will be easier to carry? Even though the backpacks are the same size, the bag that contains your books is going to be much heavier. It has a greater density than the backpack with your pillow. Density describes how much matter is in a certain amount of space. Substances that have more matter packed into a given space have higher densities. The water in a drinking glass has the same density as the water in a bathtub or swimming pool. All substances have characteristic densities, which does not depend on how much of a substance you have. Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object. The amount of space an object takes up is described by its volume. The density of an object depends on its mass and its volume. Density can be calculated using the following equation: Density = Mass/Volume Samples that are the same size, but have different densities, will have different masses. Gold has a density of about 19 g/cm3 . Pyrite has a density of only about 5 g/cm3 . Quartz is even less dense than pyrite, and has a density of 2.7 g/cm3 . If you picked up a piece of pyrite and a piece of quartz that were the same size, the pyrite would seem almost twice as heavy as the quartz.

208,"Context: As you can see, diamond is a 10 on the Mohs Hardness Scale. Diamond is the hardest mineral; no other mineral can scratch a diamond. Quartz is a 7. It can be scratched by topaz, corundum, and diamond. Quartz will scratch minerals that have a lower number on the scale. Fluorite is one. Suppose you had a piece of pure gold. You find that calcite scratches the gold. Gypsum does not. Gypsum has a hardness of 2 and calcite is a 3. That means the hardness of gold is between gypsum and calcite. So the hardness of gold is about 2.5 on the scale. A hardness of 2.5 means that gold is a relatively soft mineral. It is only about as hard as your fingernail. Hardness 1 Mineral Talc

Answer:",D
224,"Context: When water evaporates, it leaves behind a solid precipitate of minerals, as shown in Figure 1.2. When the water in glass A evaporates, the dissolved mineral particles are left behind. Water can only hold a certain amount of dissolved minerals and salts. When the amount is too great to stay dissolved in the water, the particles come together to form mineral solids, which sink. Halite easily precipitates out of water, as does calcite. Some lakes, such as Mono Lake in California (Figure 1.3) or The Great Salt Lake in Utah, contain many mineral precipitates. Tufa towers form when calcium-rich spring water at the bottom of Mono Lake bubbles up into the alkaline lake. The tufa towers appear when lake level drops. 
Question: When water evaporates, any dissolved elements are left behind as mineral deposits. The amount of minerals deposited
Options:(A) is the same as the original amount of water (B) equals the amount of minerals dissolved in the water (C) is determined by the type of minerals that form (D) depends on the rate at which the water evaporates
Answer:",B
225,"Context: A liquid can also change to a gas without boiling. This process is called evaporation. It occurs when particles at the exposed surface of a liquid absorb just enough energy to pull away from the liquid and escape into the air. This happens faster at warmer temperatures. Look at the puddle in Figure 4.21. It formed in a pothole during a rain shower. The puddle will eventually evaporate. It will evaporate faster if the sun comes out and heats the water than if the sky remains cloudy. 
Question: As the water in a solution evaporates,
Options:(A) all dissolved elements evaporate too (B) a chemical reaction occurs to help create minerals (C) it leaves behind a solid layer of minerals (D) nothing happens
Answer:",C
226,"Context: Underground water can be heated by magma. The hot water moves through cracks below Earths surface. Hot water can hold more dissolved particles than cold water. The hot, salty solution has chemical reactions with the rocks around it. The water picks up more dissolved particles. As it flows through open spaces in rocks, the water deposits solid minerals. When a mineral fills cracks in rocks, the deposits are called veins. Figure 3.20 shows a white quartz vein. When the minerals are deposited in open spaces, large crystals grow. These rocks are called geodes. Figure 3.20 shows a geode that was formed when amethyst crystals grew in an open space in a rock.

243,"Context: A water molecule has a very simple chemical formula, H2 O, two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom. But water is pretty remarkable in terms of all the things it can do. Remember that water is a polar molecule. The positive side of the molecule attracts negative ions and the negative side attracts positive ions. So water molecules separate the ions from their compounds and surround them. Water can completely dissolve some minerals, such as salt. Weathered rock in Walnut Canyon near Flagstaff, Arizona. Hydrolysis is the name of the chemical reaction between a chemical compound and water. When this reaction takes place, water dissolves ions from the mineral and carries them away. These elements have been leached. Through hydrolysis, a mineral such as potassium feldspar is leached of potassium and changed into a clay mineral.

254,"Context: The roughly 1,000 silicate minerals make up over 90% of Earths crust. Silicates are by far the largest mineral group. Feldspar and quartz are the two most common silicate minerals. Both are extremely common rock-forming minerals. The basic building block for all silicate minerals is the silica tetrahedron, which is illustrated in Figure 1.1. To create the wide variety of silicate minerals, this pyramid-shaped structure is often bound to other elements, such as calcium, iron, and magnesium. Silica tetrahedrons combine together in six different ways to create different types of silicates (Figure 1.2). Tetrahe- drons can stand alone, form connected circles called rings, link into single and double chains, form large flat sheets of pyramids, or join in three dimensions. One silicon atom bonds to four oxygen atoms to form a silica tetrahedron. The different ways that silica tetrahedrons can join together cause these two minerals to look very different.

The valuable minerals must be separated from the waste rock. One way to do this is with a chemical reaction. Chemicals are added to the ores at very high temperatures. For example, getting aluminum from waste rock uses a lot of energy. This is because temperatures greater than 900o C are needed to separate out the aluminum. It also takes a huge amount of electricity. If you recycle just 40 aluminum cans, you will save the energy in one gallon of gasoline. We use over 80 billion cans each year.

A few methods for extracting ore are: heap leaching: the addition of chemicals, such as cyanide or acid, to remove ore. flotation: the addition of a compound that attaches to the valuable mineral and floats. smelting: roasting rock, causing it to segregate into layers so the mineral can be extracted. To extract the metal from the ore, the rock is melted at a temperature greater than 900o C, which requires a lot of energy. Extracting metal from rock is so energy-intensive that if you recycle just 40 aluminum cans, you will save the energy equivalent of one gallon of gasoline.

277,"Context: There are many ways that rocks can be broken apart into smaller pieces. Ice wedging is the main form of mechanical weathering in any climate that regularly cycles above and below the freezing point (Figure 1.1). Ice wedging works quickly, breaking apart rocks in areas with temperatures that cycle above and below freezing in the day and night, and also that cycle above and below freezing with the seasons. Ice wedging breaks apart so much rock that large piles of broken rock are seen at the base of a hillside, as rock fragments separate and tumble down. Ice wedging is common in Earths polar regions and mid latitudes, and also at higher elevations, such as in the mountains.

289,"Context: The lithosphere is composed of both the crust and the portion of the upper mantle that behaves as a brittle, rigid solid. The lithosphere is the outermost mechanical layer, which behaves as a brittle, rigid solid. The lithosphere is about 100 kilometers thick. How are crust and lithosphere different from each other? The definition of the lithosphere is based on how Earth materials behave, so it includes the crust and the uppermost mantle, which are both brittle. Since it is rigid and brittle, when stresses act on the lithosphere, it breaks. This is what we experience as an earthquake. Although we sometimes refer to Earths plates as being plates of crust, the plates are actually made of lithosphere. Much more about Earths plates follows in the chapter ""Plate Tectonics.""

290,"Context: At the planets center lies a dense metallic core. Scientists know that the core is metal because: 1. The density of Earths surface layers is much less than the overall density of the planet, as calculated from the planets rotation. If the surface layers are less dense than average, then the interior must be denser than average. Calculations indicate that the core is about 85% iron metal with nickel metal making up much of the remaining 15%. 2. Metallic meteorites are thought to be representative of the core. The 85% iron/15% nickel calculation above is also seen in metallic meteorites (Figure 1.1). If Earths core were not metal, the planet would not have a magnetic field. Metals such as iron are magnetic, but rock, which makes up the mantle and crust, is not. Scientists know that the outer core is liquid and the inner core is solid because: 1. S-waves do not go through the outer core. 2. The strong magnetic field is caused by convection in the liquid outer core. Convection currents in the outer core are due to heat from the even hotter inner core. The heat that keeps the outer core from solidifying is produced by the breakdown of radioactive elements in the inner core. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:

311,"Context: Beneath the crust is the mantle. The mantle is made of hot, solid rock. Through the process of conduction, heat flows from warmer objects to cooler objects (Figure 6.4). The lower mantle is heated directly by conduction from the core. Hot lower mantle material rises upwards (Figure 6.5). As it rises, it cools. At the top of the mantle it moves horizontally. Over time it becomes cool and dense enough that it sinks. Back at the bottom of the mantle, it travels horizontally. Eventually the material gets to the location where warm mantle material is rising. The rising and sinking of warm and cooler material is convection. The motion described creates a convection cell.

The definition of the lithosphere is based on how Earth materials behave, so it includes the crust and the uppermost mantle, which are both brittle. Since it is rigid and brittle, when stresses act on the lithosphere, it breaks. This is what we experience as an earthquake. Although we sometimes refer to Earths plates as being plates of crust, the plates are actually made of lithosphere. Much more about Earths plates follows in the chapter ""Plate Tectonics.""

322,"Context: The features of the seafloor and the patterns of magnetic polarity symmetrically about the mid-ocean ridges were the pieces that Hess needed. He resurrected Wegeners continental drift hypothesis and also the mantle convection idea of Holmes. Hess wrote that hot magma rose up into the rift valley at the mid-ocean ridges. The lava oozed up and forced the existing seafloor away from the rift in opposite directions. Since magnetite crystals point in the direction of the magnetic north pole as the lava cools, the different stripes of magnetic polarity revealed the different ages of the seafloor. The seafloor at the ridge is from the Brunhes normal; beyond that is basalt from the Matuyama reverse; and beyond that from the Gauss normal. Hess called this idea seafloor spreading. As oceanic crust forms and spreads, moving away from the ridge crest, it pushes the continent away from the ridge axis. If the oceanic crust reaches a deep sea trench, it sinks into the trench and is lost into the mantle. The oldest crust is coldest and lies deepest in the ocean because it is less buoyant than the hot new crust. Hess could also use seafloor spreading to explain the flat topped guyots. He suggested that they were once active volcanoes that were exposed to erosion above sea level. As the seafloor they sat on moved away from the ridge, the crust on which they sat become less buoyant and the guyots moved deeper beneath sea level. 
Question: hypothesis explaining how the ocean floor forms

Answer:",D
323,"Context: The people who first mapped the seafloor were aboard military vessels during World War II. As stated in the Earth as a Planet chapter, echo sounders used sound waves to search for submarines, but also produced a map of seafloor depths. Depth sounding continued in earnest after the war. Scientists pieced together the ocean depths to produce bathymetric maps of the seafloor. During WWII and in the decade or so later, echo sounders had only one beam, so they just returned a line showing the depth beneath the ship. Later echo sounders sent out multiple beams and could create a bathymetric map of the seafloor below. We will run a multi-beam echo sounder as we go from Woods Hole out to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. 
Question: Before echo sounders, scientists thought topography of the seafloor

325,"Context: There is a lot of volcanic activity at divergent plate boundaries in the oceans. As the plates pull away from each other, they create deep fissures. Molten lava erupts through these cracks. The East Pacific Rise is a divergent plate boundary in the Pacific Ocean (Figure 8.2). The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a divergent plate boundary in the Atlantic Ocean. Continents can also rift apart. When mantle gets close enough to the surface, volcanoes form. Eventually, a rift valley will create a new mid-ocean ridge.

332,"Context: Although they expected an expanse of flat, featureless plains, scientists were shocked to find tremendous features like mountain ranges, rifts, and trenches. This work continues on oceanographic research vessels as they sail across the seas today. The map in the Figure 1.2 is a modern map with data from several decades. The major features of the ocean basins and their colors on the map in Figure 1.2 include: mid-ocean ridges: these features rise up high above the deep seafloor as a long chain of mountains, e.g. the light blue gash in middle of Atlantic Ocean. rift zones: in the middle of the mid-ocean ridges is a rift zone that is lower in elevation than the mountains surrounding it. deep sea trenches: these features are found at the edges of continents or in the sea near chains of active volcanoes, e.g. the very deepest blue, off of western South America. abyssal plains: these features are flat areas, although many are dotted with volcanic mountains, e.g. consistent blue off of southeastern South America. See if you can identify each of these features in Figure 1.2. A modern map of the southeastern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. When they first observed these bathymetric maps, scientists wondered what had formed these features. It turns out that they were crucial for fitting together ideas about seafloor spreading.

335,"Context: But during the war, battleships and submarines carried echo sounders. Their goal was to locate enemy submarines (Figure 6.9). Echo sounders produce sound waves that travel outward in all directions. The sound waves bounce off the nearest object, and then return to the ship. Scientists know the speed of sound in seawater.

344,"Context: The scientists used geologic dating techniques on seafloor rocks. They found that the youngest rocks on the seafloor were at the mid-ocean ridges. The rocks get older with distance from the ridge crest. The scientists were surprised to find that the oldest seafloor is less than 180 million years old. This may seem old, but the oldest continental crust is around 4 billion years old. Scientists also discovered that the mid-ocean ridge crest is nearly sediment free. The crust is also very thin there. With distance from the ridge crest, the sediments and crust get thicker. This also supports the idea that the youngest rocks are on the ridge axis and that the rocks get older with distance away from the ridge (Figure 6.12).

Answer:",A
360,"Context: The Earth is divided into many plates. These plates move around on the surface. The plates collide or slide past each other. One may even plunge beneath another. Plate motions cause most geological activity. This activity includes earthquakes, volcanoes, and the buildup of mountains. The reason for plate movement is convection in the mantle. Earth is the only planet that we know has plate tectonics. 
Question: Plates move over Earths surface at a rate of

Answer:",C
361,"Context: A divergent plate boundary can also occur within a continent. This is called continental rifting (Figure 6.18). Magma rises beneath the continent. The crust thins, breaks, and then splits apart. This first produces a rift valley. The East African Rift is a rift valley. Eastern Africa is splitting away from the African continent. Eventually, as the continental crust breaks apart, oceanic crust will form. This is how the Atlantic Ocean formed when Pangaea broke up. 
Question: If a divergent plate boundary is found within a continent,
Options:(A) a line of volcanoes forms (B) a subduction zone forms (C) the continent rifts apart (D) none of these
Answer:",C
362,"Context: Two oceanic plates may collide. In this case, the older plate is denser. This plate subducts beneath the younger plate. As the subducting plate is pushed deeper into the mantle, it melts. The magma this creates rises and erupts. This forms a line of volcanoes, known as an island arc (Figure 6.21). Japan, Indonesia, the Philippine Islands, and the Aleutian Islands of Alaska are examples of island arcs (Figure 6.22).

Question: Plates move over Earths surface because of
Options:(A) conduction within the crust (B) subduction in the outer core (C) radiation from the inner core (D) convection within the mantle
Answer:",D
364,"Context: At divergent plate boundaries hot mantle rock rises into the space where the plates are moving apart. As the hot mantle rock convects upward it rises higher in the mantle. The rock is under lower pressure; this lowers the melting temperature of the rock and so it melts. Lava erupts through long cracks in the ground, or fissures.

Question: Plate tectonics theory says that
Options:(A) Earths geography has been the same for all geologic time (B) Earths geography is continually changing (C) all geological activity happens at plate boundaries (D) continents drift but scientists do not yet know why
Answer:",B
366,"Context: Melting at convergent plate boundaries has many causes. The subducting plate heats up as it sinks into the mantle. Also, water is mixed in with the sediments lying on top of the subducting plate. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material and lowers its melting point. Melting in the mantle above the subducting plate leads to volcanoes within an island or continental arc. 
Question: The edge of a plate sinks into the mantle
Options:(A) where two plates diverge (B) at a subduction zone (C) at a transform boundary (D) none of the above
Answer:",B
367,"Context: Continental lithosphere is low in density and very thick. Continental lithosphere cannot subduct. So when two continental plates collide, they just smash together, just like if you put your hands on two sides of a sheet of paper and bring your hands together. The material has nowhere to go but up (Figure 6.23)! Earthquakes and metamorphic rocks result from the tremendous forces of the collision. But the crust is too thick for magma to get through, so there are no volcanoes. 
Question: Continental plates do not subduct because they
Options:(A) are very thick and low in density (B) do not collide with other plates (C) have only intraplate activity (D) two of the above
Answer:",A
368,"Context: Most geological activity takes place at plate boundaries. But some activity does not. Much of this intraplate activity is found at hot spots. Hotspot volcanoes form as plumes of hot magma rise from deep in the mantle. 
Question: All volcanoes and earthquakes take place at plate boundaries.

Answer:",B
377,"Context: There is a lot of volcanic activity at divergent plate boundaries in the oceans. As the plates pull away from each other, they create deep fissures. Molten lava erupts through these cracks. The East Pacific Rise is a divergent plate boundary in the Pacific Ocean (Figure 8.2). The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a divergent plate boundary in the Atlantic Ocean. Continents can also rift apart. When mantle gets close enough to the surface, volcanoes form. Eventually, a rift valley will create a new mid-ocean ridge. 
Question: Mid-ocean ridges occur at convergent plate boundaries.

Answer:",B
378,"Context: Lots of volcanoes form along subduction plate boundaries. The edges of the Pacific Plate are a long subduction boundary. Lines of volcanoes can form at subduction zones on oceanic or continental crust. Japan is an example of a volcanic arc on oceanic crust. The Cascade Range and Andes Mountains are volcanic arcs on continental crust. 
Question: Many volcanoes occur along subduction zones.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
379,"Context: Most of the worlds largest mountains form as plates collide at convergent plate boundaries. Continents are too buoyant to get pushed down into the mantle. So when the plates smash together, the crust crumples upwards. This creates mountains. Folding and faulting in these collision zones makes the crust thicker. The worlds highest mountain range, the Himalayas, is growing as India collides with Eurasia. About 80 million years ago, India was separated from Eurasia by an ocean (Figure 7.16). As the plates collided, pieces of the old seafloor were forced over the Asian continent. This old seafloor is now found high in the Himalayas (Figure 7.17).

381,"Context: Scientists think that Pangaea was not the first supercontinent. There were others before it. The continents are now moving together. This is because of subduction around the Pacific Ocean. Eventually, the Pacific will disappear and a new supercontinent will form. This wont be for hundreds of millions of years. The creation and breakup of a supercontinent takes place about every 500 million years. 
Question: Scientists think that Pangaea was the first supercontinent.

382,"Context: The moving continents collided with island arcs and microcontinents so that mountain ranges accreted onto the continents edges. The subduction of the oceanic Farallon plate beneath western North America during the late In the Afar Region of Ethiopia, Africa is splitting apart. Three plates are pulling away from a central point. Jurassic and early Cretaceous produced igneous intrusions and other structures. The intrusions have since been uplifted so that they are exposed in the Sierra Nevada Mountains (Figure 1.2). The snow-covered Sierra Nevada is seen striking SE to NW across the eastern third of the image. The mountain range is a line of uplifted batholiths from Mesozoic subduction.

Answer:",B
386,"Context: Oceanic crust may collide with a continent. The oceanic plate is denser, so it undergoes subduction. This means that the oceanic plate sinks beneath the continent. This occurs at an ocean trench (Figure 6.19). Subduction zones are where subduction takes place. As you would expect, where plates collide there are lots of intense earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The subducting oceanic plate melts as it reenters the mantle. The magma rises and erupts. This creates a volcanic mountain range near the coast of the continent. This range is called a volcanic arc. The Andes Mountains, along the western edge of South America, are a volcanic arc (Figure 6.20).

An intermediate-focus earthquake has a focus between 70 and 300 kilometers (45 to 200 miles). A deep-focus earthquake is greater than 300 kilometers (200 miles). About 75% of earthquakes have a focus in the top 10 to 15 kilometers (6 to 9 miles) of the crust. Shallow earthquakes cause the most damage. This is because the focus is near the Earths surface, where people live. 
Question: Earthquakes deep underground cause the most damage.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
393,"Context: Earthquakes also occur at divergent plate boundaries. At mid-ocean ridges, these earthquakes tend to be small and shallow focus because the plates are thin, young, and hot.

397,"Context: Earthquakes can cause tsunami. These deadly ocean waves may result from any shock to ocean water. A shock could be a meteorite impact, landslide, or a nuclear explosion. An underwater earthquake creates a tsunami this way: The movement of the crust displaces water. The displacement forms a set of waves. The waves travel at jet speed through the ocean. Since the waves have low amplitudes and long wavelengths, they are unnoticed in deep water. As the waves reach shore they compress. They are also pushed upward by the shore. For these reasons, tsunami can grow to enormous wave heights. Tsunami waves can cause tremendous destruction and loss of life. Fortunately, few undersea earthquakes generate tsunami.

400,"Context: Figure 14.9 also shows how the size of waves is measured. The highest point of a wave is the crest. The lowest point is the trough. The vertical distance between a crest and a trough is the height of the wave. Wave height is also called amplitude. The horizontal distance between two crests is the wavelength. Both amplitude and wavelength are measures of wave size. The size of an ocean wave depends on how fast, over how great a distance, and how long the wind blows. The greater each of these factors is, the bigger a wave will be. Some of the biggest waves occur with hurricanes. A hurricane is a storm that forms over the ocean. Its winds may blow more than 150 miles per hour! The winds also travel over long distances and may last for many days.

410,"Context: Wavelength is one way of measuring the size of waves. It is the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves, and it is usually measured in meters. How it is measured is a little different for transverse and longitudinal waves. In a transverse wave, particles of the medium vibrate up and down at right angles to the direction that the wave travels. The wavelength of a transverse wave can be measured as the distance between two adjacent crests, or high points, as shown in the Figure 1.1. In a longitudinal wave, particles of matter vibrate back and forth in the same direction that the wave travels. The wavelength of a longitudinal wave can be measured as the distance between two adjacent compressions, as shown in the Figure 1.2. Compressions are the places where particles of the medium crowd close together as the energy of the wave passes through.

423,"Context: One seismogram indicates the distance to the epicenter. This is determined by the P-and S-wave arrival times. If a quake is near the seismograph, the S-waves arrive shortly after the P-waves. If a quake is far from the seismograph, the P-waves arrive long before the S-waves. The longer the time is between the P-and S-wave arrivals, the further away the earthquake was from the seismograph. First, seismologists calculate the arrival time difference. Then they know the distance to the epicenter from that seismograph. Next, the seismologists try to determine the location of the earthquake epicenter. To do this they need the distances to the epicenter from at least three seismographs. Lets say that they know that an earthquakes epicenter is 50 kilometers from Kansas City. They draw a circle with a 50 km radius around that seismic station. They do this twice more around two different seismic stations. The three circles intersect at a single point. This is the earthquakes epicenter (Figure 7.35).

The Mercalli Intensity Scale describes earthquake intensity. There are many problems with the Mercalli scale. The damage from an earthquake is affected by many things. Different people experience an earthquake differently. Using this scale, comparisons between earthquakes were difficult to make. A new scale was needed.

440,"Context: Scientists are not able to predict earthquakes. Since nearly all earthquakes take place at plate boundaries, scientists can predict where an earthquake will occur (Figure 7.37). This information helps communities to prepare for an earthquake. For example, they can require that structures are built to be earthquake safe. Predicting when an earthquake will occur is much more difficult. Scientists can look at how often earthquakes have struck in the past. This does not allow an accurate prediction for the future. Small tremors, called foreshocks, often happen a short time before a major quake. The ground may also tilt as stress builds up in the rocks. Water levels in wells also change as groundwater moves through rock fractures. These do not usually allow accurate predictions. Folklore tells of animals behaving strangely just before an earthquake. Most people tell stories of these behaviors after the earthquake. Chinese scientists actively study the behavior of animals before earthquakes to see if there is a connection. So far nothing concrete has come of these studies. Once an earthquake has started, many actions must take place. Seismometers can detect P-waves a few seconds before more damaging S-waves and surface waves arrive. Although a few seconds is not much, computers can shut down gas mains and electrical transmission lines. They can initiate protective measures in chemical plants, nuclear power plants, mass transit systems, airports, and roadways.

447,"Context: The Richter scale and the moment magnitude scale are logarithmic scales. The amplitude of the largest wave increases ten times from one integer to the next. An increase in one integer means that thirty times more energy was released. These two scales often give very similar measurements. How does the amplitude of the largest seismic wave of a magnitude 5 earthquake compare with the largest wave of a magnitude 4 earthquake? How does it compare with a magnitude 3 quake? The amplitude of the largest seismic wave of a magnitude 5 quake is 10 times that of a magnitude 4 quake and 100 times that of a magnitude 3 quake. How does an increase in two integers on the moment magnitude scale compare in terms of the amount of energy released? Two integers equals a 900-fold increase in released energy.

448,"Context: Earthquake magnitude affects how much damage is done in an earthquake. A larger earthquake damages more buildings and kills more people than a smaller earthquake. But thats not the only factor that determines earthquake damage. The location of an earthquake relative to a large city is important. More damage is done if the ground shakes for a long time. The amount of damage also depends on the geology of the region. Strong, solid bedrock shakes less than soft or wet soils. Wet soils liquefy during an earthquake and become like quicksand. Soil on a hillside that is shaken loose can become a landslide. Hazard maps help city planners choose the best locations for buildings (Figure 7.38). For example, when faced with two possible locations for a new hospital, planners must build on bedrock rather than silt and clay.

Answer:",D
449,"Context: We know that earthquakes kill lots of people. However, the ground shaking almost never kills people, and the ground does not swallow someone up. Fatalities depend somewhat on an earthquakes size and the type of ground people inhabit. But much of what determines the number of fatalities depends on the quality of structures. People are killed when structures fall on them. More damage is done and more people are killed by the fires that follow an earthquake than the earthquake itself.

Larger buildings must sway, but not so much that they touch nearby buildings. Counterweights and diagonal steel beams are used to hold down sway. Large buildings can be placed on rollers so that they move with the ground. Buildings may be placed on layers of steel and rubber to absorb the shock of the waves. Connections, such as where the walls meet the foundation, must be made strong. In a multi-story building, the first story must be well supported (Figure 1.1).

The Indian Ocean earthquake of 2004 was one of the largest ever, but most of the 230,000 fatalities were caused by the tsunami, not the earthquake itself. Ground type. Solid bedrock vibrates less than soft sediments, so there is less damage on bedrock. Sediments that are saturated with water undergo liquefaction and become like quicksand (Figure 1.2). Soil on a hillside may become a landslide. Liquefaction of sediments in Mexico City caused the collapse of many buildings in the 1985 earthquake.

Answer:",A
452,"Context: The amount of damage depends on the amount of development in the region. The 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake, near Anchorage, was the largest earthquake ever recorded in North America. The gigantic quake had a magnitude of 9.2. The earthquake lasted for several minutes and the ground slipped up to 11.5 meters (38 feet). An area of 100,000 square miles (250,000 square km) was affected. The ground liquefied, causing landslides (Figure 7.40). The earthquake occurred at a subduction zone, and large tsunami up to 70 meters (20 feet) high were created. Despite the intensity of the earthquake, only 131 people died. Most deaths were due to the tsunami. Property damage was just over $300 million ($1.8 billion in 2007 U.S. dollars). The reason there was such a small amount of damage is that very few people lived in the area (Alaska had only been a state for five years!). A similar earthquake today would affect many more people.

Question: The projected Mercalli Intensity scale for a future earthquake is used by city planners in earthquake
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
471,"Context: To make older buildings more earthquake safe, retrofitting with steel or wood can reinforce a buildings structure and its connections. Elevated freeways and bridges can also be retrofitted so that they do not collapse. Steel trusses were built diagonally and horizontally across windows to retrofit a building at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. The San Andreas Fault passes just west of the university. 
Question: Elevated freeways can be retrofitted for earthquakes.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
472,"Context: An earthquake is sudden ground movement caused by the sudden release of energy stored in rocks. Earthquakes happen when so much stress builds up in the rocks that the rocks rupture. The energy is transmitted by seismic waves. Earthquakes can be so small they go completely unnoticed, or so large that it can take years for a region to recover. 
Question: All earthquake damage is caused by the ground shaking.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
473,"Context: Earthquake magnitude affects how much damage is done in an earthquake. A larger earthquake damages more buildings and kills more people than a smaller earthquake. But thats not the only factor that determines earthquake damage. The location of an earthquake relative to a large city is important. More damage is done if the ground shakes for a long time. The amount of damage also depends on the geology of the region. Strong, solid bedrock shakes less than soft or wet soils. Wet soils liquefy during an earthquake and become like quicksand. Soil on a hillside that is shaken loose can become a landslide. Hazard maps help city planners choose the best locations for buildings (Figure 7.38). For example, when faced with two possible locations for a new hospital, planners must build on bedrock rather than silt and clay. 
Question: A stronger earthquake always causes more damage than a weaker earthquake.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
474,"Context: We know that earthquakes kill lots of people. However, the ground shaking almost never kills people, and the ground does not swallow someone up. Fatalities depend somewhat on an earthquakes size and the type of ground people inhabit. But much of what determines the number of fatalities depends on the quality of structures. People are killed when structures fall on them. More damage is done and more people are killed by the fires that follow an earthquake than the earthquake itself. 
Question: An earthquake always causes more deaths in cities closer to the epicenter.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
475,"Context: The amount of damage depends on the amount of development in the region. The 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake, near Anchorage, was the largest earthquake ever recorded in North America. The gigantic quake had a magnitude of 9.2. The earthquake lasted for several minutes and the ground slipped up to 11.5 meters (38 feet). An area of 100,000 square miles (250,000 square km) was affected. The ground liquefied, causing landslides (Figure 7.40). The earthquake occurred at a subduction zone, and large tsunami up to 70 meters (20 feet) high were created. Despite the intensity of the earthquake, only 131 people died. Most deaths were due to the tsunami. Property damage was just over $300 million ($1.8 billion in 2007 U.S. dollars). The reason there was such a small amount of damage is that very few people lived in the area (Alaska had only been a state for five years!). A similar earthquake today would affect many more people. 
Question: The Great Alaska Earthquake had a magnitude greater than 9 on the Richter scale.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
476,"Context: Not everyone had the same warning the people on Tillys beach had. The Boxing Day Tsunami of December 26, 2004 was by far the deadliest of all time (Figure 1.1). The tsunami was caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake. With a magnitude of 9.2, it was the second largest earthquake ever recorded. The extreme movement of the crust displaced trillions of tons of water along the entire length of the rupture. Several tsunami waves were created with about 30 minutes between the peaks of each one. The waves that struck nearby Sumatra 15 minutes after the quake reached more than 10 meters (33 feet) in height. The size of the waves decreased with distance from the earthquake and were about 4 meters (13 feet) high in Somalia. The tsunami did so much damage because it traveled throughout the Indian Ocean. About 230,000 people died in eight countries. There were fatalities even as far away as South Africa, nearly 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) from the earthquake epicenter. More than 1.2 million people lost their homes and many more lost their ways of making a living. The countries that were most affected by the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami. 
Question: Most deaths in the Great Alaska Earthquake were due to the tsunami.

Answer:",A
477,"Context: Buildings must be specially built to withstand earthquakes. Skyscrapers and other large structures built on soft ground must be anchored to bedrock. Sometimes that bedrock is hundreds of meters below the ground surface! 
Question: In earthquake zones, building materials should be strong and rigid.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
478,"Context: Building materials need to be both strong and flexible. Small structures, like houses, should bend and sway. Wood and steel bend. Brick, stone, and adobe are brittle and will break. Larger buildings must sway, but not so much that they touch nearby buildings. Counterweights and diagonal steel beams can hold down sway. Buildings need strong, flexible connections where the walls meet the foundation. Earthquake-safe buildings are well connected (Figure Steel or wood can be added to older buildings to reinforce a buildings structure and its connections (Figure 7.42). Elevated freeways and bridges can also be reinforced so that they do not collapse. Important structures must be designed to survive intact. 
Question: Buildings should be constructed so they do not bend and sway in an earthquake.

481,"Context: If you live in an earthquake zone, there are many things you can do to protect yourself. You must protect your home. Your household must be ready to live independently for a few days. It may take emergency services that long to get to everyone. Before an Earthquake: Make sure the floor, walls, roof, and foundation are all well attached to each other. Have an engineer evaluate your house for structural integrity. Bracket or brace brick chimneys to the roof. Be sure that heavy objects are not stored in high places. Move them to low places so that they do not fall. Secure water heaters all around and at the top and bottom. Bolt heavy furniture onto walls with bolts, screws, or strap hinges. Replace halogen and incandescent light bulbs with fluorescent bulbs to lessen fire risk. Check to see that gas lines are made of flexible material so they do not rupture. Any equipment that uses gas should be well secured. Everyone in the household should know how to shut off the gas line. A wrench should be placed nearby for doing so. Prepare an earthquake kit with at least three days supply of water and food. Include a radio and batteries. Place flashlights all over the house so there is always one available. Place one in the glove box of your car. Keep several fire extinguishers around the house to fight any small fires that break out. Be sure to have a first aid kit. Everyone in the household who is capable should know basic first aid and CPR. Plan in advance how you will evacuate your property and where you will go. Do not plan on driving, as roadways will likely be damaged. During the Earthquake: If you are in a building, drop to the ground, get beneath a sturdy table or desk, cover your head, and hold on. Stay away from windows and mirrors since glass can break and fall on you. Stay away from large furniture that may fall on you. If the building is structurally unsound, get outside as fast as possible. Run into an open area away from buildings and power lines that may fall on you. If you are in a car, stay in the car and stay away from structures that might collapse like overpasses, bridges, or buildings. After the Earthquake: Be aware that aftershocks are likely. Avoid dangerous areas, like hillsides, that may experience a landslide. Turn off water, gas lines, and power to your home. Use your phone only if there is an emergency. Many people with urgent needs will be trying to get through to emergency services. Be prepared to wait for help or instructions. Assist others as necessary. 
Question: In earthquake zones, heavy furniture should be attached securely to walls.

Answer:",A
482,"Context: Some volcanoes form over active hot spots. Scientists count about 50 hot spots on the Earth. Hot spots may be in the middle of a tectonic plate. Hot spots lie directly above a column of hot rock called a mantle plume. Mantle plumes continuously bring magma up from the mantle towards the crust (Figure 8.3). As the tectonic plates move above a hot spot, they form a chain of volcanoes. The islands of Hawaii formed over a hot spot in the middle of the Pacific plate. The Hawaii hot spot has been active for tens of millions of years. The volcanoes of the Hawaiian Islands formed at this hot spot. Older volcanoes that formed at the hot spot have eroded below sea level. These are called the Emperor Seamounts. Loihi seamount is currently active beneath the water southeast of the Big Island of Hawaii. One day the volcano will rise above sea level and join the volcanoes of the island or create a new island (Figure 8.4). Hot spots may also be active at plate boundaries. This is especially common at mid-ocean ridges. Iceland is formed by a hot spot along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Hot spots are found within continents, but not as commonly as within oceans. The Yellowstone hot spot is a famous example of a continental hot spot. 
Question: Iceland consists of volcanoes that formed over a hot spot.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
483,"Context: Volcanoes are a vibrant manifestation of plate tectonics processes. Volcanoes are common along convergent and di- vergent plate boundaries. Volcanoes are also found within lithospheric plates away from plate boundaries. Wherever mantle is able to melt, volcanoes may be the result. What is the geological reason for the locations of all the volcanoes in the figure? Does it resemble the map of earthquake epicenters? Are all of the volcanoes located along plate boundaries? Why are the Hawaiian volcanoes located away from any plate boundaries? World map of active volcanoes (red dots). 
Question: Volcanoes are scattered randomly across Earths surface.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
484,"Context: Volcanoes erupt at mid-ocean ridges, such as the Mid-Atlantic ridge, where seafloor spreading creates new seafloor in the rift valleys. Where a hotspot is located along the ridge, such as at Iceland, volcanoes grow high enough to create islands (Figure 1.3). 
Question: Many volcanoes occur along the mid-Atlantic Ridge.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
485,"Context: Oceanic crust may collide with a continent. The oceanic plate is denser, so it undergoes subduction. This means that the oceanic plate sinks beneath the continent. This occurs at an ocean trench (Figure 6.19). Subduction zones are where subduction takes place. As you would expect, where plates collide there are lots of intense earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The subducting oceanic plate melts as it reenters the mantle. The magma rises and erupts. This creates a volcanic mountain range near the coast of the continent. This range is called a volcanic arc. The Andes Mountains, along the western edge of South America, are a volcanic arc (Figure 6.20). 
Question: Volcanoes occur only in oceanic crust.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
486,"Context: A chain of volcanoes forms as an oceanic plate moves over a hot spot. This is how it happens. A volcano forms over the hotspot. Since the plate is moving, the volcano moves off of the hotspot. When the hotspot erupts again, a new volcano forms over it. This volcano is in line with the first. Over time, there is a line of volcanoes. The youngest is directly above the hot spot. The oldest is the furthest away (Figure 6.27). The Hawaii-Emperor chain of volcanoes formed over the Hawaiian Hotspot. The Hawaiian Islands formed most 
Question: Chains of volcanoes form above hot spots because of plate tectonics.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
487,"Context: The first photo above is of a volcanic eruption in Hawaii. Hawaii is not in western North America, but is in the central Pacific ocean, near the middle of the Pacific Plate. The Hawaiian Islands are a beautiful example of a hotspot chain in the Pacific Ocean. Kilauea volcano lies above the Hawaiian hotspot. Mauna Loa volcano is older than Kilauea and is still erupting, but at a slower rate. The islands get progressively older to the northwest because they are further from the hotspot. This is because the Pacific Plate is moving toward the northwest over the hotspot. Loihi, the youngest volcano, is still below the sea surface. Since many hotspots are stationary in the mantle, geologists can use some hotspot chains to tell the direction and the speed a plate is moving (Figure 1.2). The Hawaiian chain continues into the Emperor Seamounts. The bend in the chain was caused by a change in the direction of the Pacific Plate 43 million years ago. Using the age and distance of the bend, geologists can figure out the speed of the Pacific Plate over the hotspot. The Hawaiian Islands have formed from volcanic eruptions above the Hawaii hotspot. 
Question: The Hawaiian hot spot is no longer active.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
488,"Context: Hot spots are also found under the continental crust. Since it is more difficult for magma to make it through the thick crust, they are much less common. One exception is the Yellowstone hotspot (Figure 6.28). This hotspot is very active. In the past, the hotspot produced enormous volcanic eruptions. Now its activity is best seen in the regions famous geysers. 
Question: Hot spots never occur under continental crust.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
489,"Context: Although most volcanoes are found at convergent or divergent plate boundaries, intraplate volcanoes may be found in the middle of a tectonic plate. These volcanoes rise at a hotspot above a mantle plume. Melting at a hotspot is due to pressure release as the plume rises through the mantle. Earth is home to about 50 known hotspots. Most of these are in the oceans because they are better able to penetrate oceanic lithosphere to create volcanoes. But there are some large ones in the continents. Yellowstone is a good example of a mantle plume erupting within a continent. 
Question: The majority of mantle plumes are found under the ocean basins.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
490,"Context: Most geological activity takes place at plate boundaries. But some activity does not. Much of this intraplate activity is found at hot spots. Hotspot volcanoes form as plumes of hot magma rise from deep in the mantle. 
Question: All hot spots are in the middle of tectonic plates.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
491,"Context: Great volcanic explosions and glowing red rivers of lava are fascinating. All igneous rock comes from magma or lava. Remember that magma is molten rock that is below Earths surface. Lava is molten rock at Earths surface.

Question: column of hot rock that lies below a hot spot
Options:(A) volcano (B) magma (C) lava (D) hot spot (E) mantle plume (F) plate boundary (G) fissure
Answer:",E
493,"Context: At divergent plate boundaries hot mantle rock rises into the space where the plates are moving apart. As the hot mantle rock convects upward it rises higher in the mantle. The rock is under lower pressure; this lowers the melting temperature of the rock and so it melts. Lava erupts through long cracks in the ground, or fissures. 
Question: crack in Earths crust where magma pushes up through the crust

Answer:",F
496,"Context: A small amount of geologic activity, known as intraplate activity, does not take place at plate boundaries but within a plate instead. Mantle plumes are pipes of hot rock that rise through the mantle. The release of pressure causes melting near the surface to form a hotspot. Eruptions at the hotspot create a volcano. Hotspot volcanoes are found in a line (Figure 1.1). Can you figure out why? Hint: The youngest volcano sits above the hotspot and volcanoes become older with distance from the hotspot. 
Question: fixed spot where magma rises through the crust and creates volcanoes

497,"Context: You are on vacation at the beach. You take your flip-flops off so you can go swimming. The sand is so hot it hurts your feet. You have to run to the water. Now imagine if it were hot enough for the sand to melt. Some places inside Earth are so hot that rock melts. Melted rock inside the Earth is called magma. Magma can be hotter than 1,000C. When magma erupts onto Earths surface, it is known as lava, as Figure 3.17 shows. Minerals form when magma and lava cool. 
Question: name for melted rock under Earths surface
Options:(A) volcano (B) magma (C) lava (D) hot spot (E) mantle plume (F) plate boundary (G) fissure
Answer:",B
498,"Context: The process in which rocks or other solids change to liquids is called melting. Melting occurs when particles of a solid absorb enough energy to partly overcome the force of attraction holding them together. This allows them to move out of their fixed positions and slip over one another. Melting, like other changes of state, is a physical change in matter, so it doesnt change the chemical makeup or chemical properties of matter. Q: The molten rock that erupts from a volcano comes from deep underground. How is this related to its liquid state? A: It is always very hot deep underground where molten rock originates. The high temperatures give rock enough energy to melt and remain in a molten state. Underground rock in this state is called magma. Q: What happens to magma after it erupts and starts flowing over the surface of the ground? A: After magma erupts, it is called lava. On the surface, lava eventually cools and hardens to form solid rock. Other substances that are normally solids on Earth can also be heated until they melt. You can see an example in the Figure 1.1. The photo shows molten gold being poured into a mold. When the gold cools, it will harden into a solid gold bar that has the same shape as the mold.

499,"Context: As we have seen, the ocean floor is not flat: mid-ocean ridges, deep sea trenches, and other features all rise sharply above or plunge deeply below the abyssal plains. In fact, Earths tallest mountain is Mauna Kea volcano, which rises 10,203 m (33,476 ft.)meters) from the Pacific Ocean floor to become one of the volcanic mountains of Hawaii. The deepest canyon is also on the ocean floor, the Challenger Deep in the Marianas Trench, 10,916 m (35,814 ft).

506,"Context: Magma and gas can push the volcanos slope upward. Most ground deformation is subtle and can only be detected by tiltmeters, which are instruments that measure the angle of the slope of a volcano. But ground swelling may sometimes create huge changes in the shape of a volcano. Mount St. Helens grew a bulge on its north side before its 1980 eruption. Ground swelling may also increase rock falls and landslides.

Question: Non-explosive eruptions
Options:(A) cause little damage (B) rarely kill anyone (C) have lavas that contain a lot of gas (D) all of these
Answer:",B
508,"Context: Imagine a rock that becomes so hot it melts. Many minerals start out in liquids that are hot enough to melt rocks. Magma is melted rock inside Earth, a molten mixture of substances that can be hotter than 1,000 C. Magma cools slowly inside Earth, which gives mineral crystals time to grow large enough to be seen clearly (Figure 1.1). Granite is rock that forms from slowly cooled magma, containing the minerals quartz (clear), plagioclase feldspar (shiny white), potassium feldspar (pink), and bi- otite (black). When magma erupts onto Earths surface, it is called lava. Lava cools much more rapidly than magma. Crystals do not have time to form and are very small. The chemical composition between minerals that form rapidly or slowly is often the same, only their size differs. Existing rocks may be heated enough so that the molecules are released from their structure and can move around. The molecules may match up with different molecules to form new minerals as the rock cools. This occurs during metamorphism, which will be discussed in the ""Metamorphic Rocks"" concept. 
Question: Compared with the solid rock around it, magma is
Options:(A) cooler (B) harder (C) less dense (D) two of the above

509,"Context: Of all the volcanoes in the world, very few are erupting at any given time. Scientists question whether a volcano that is not erupting will ever erupt again and then describe it as active, dormant, or extinct. Active: currently erupting or showing signs of erupting soon. Dormant: no current activity, but has erupted recently. Extinct: no activity for some time; will probably not erupt again. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:

Answer:",D
510,"Context: Magma forms deep beneath the Earths surface. Rock melts below the surface under tremendous pressure and high temperatures. Molten rock flows like taffy or hot wax. Most magmas are formed at temperatures between 600o C and 1300o C (Figure 8.8). Magma collects in magma chambers beneath Earths surface. Magma chambers are located where the heat and pressure are great enough to melt rock. These locations are at divergent or convergent plate boundaries or at hotpots. The chemistry of a magma determines the type of igneous rock it forms. The chemistry also determines how the magma moves. Thicker magmas tend to stay below the surface or erupt explosively. When magma is fluid and runny, it often reaches the surface by flowing out in rivers of lava. 
Question: The deepest magma chambers are about
Options:(A) 16 km below the surface (B) 160 km below the surface (C) 1600 km below the surface (D) 16 (E) 000 km below the surface

Options:(A) earthquakes (B) rock fall (C) temperature (D) deformation and gases (E) d nothing; satellites are too high up
Answer:",C
513,"Context: An explosive eruption produces huge clouds of volcanic ash. Chunks of the volcano fly high into the atmosphere. Explosive eruptions can be 10,000 times as powerful as an atomic bomb (Figure 8.6). Hot magma beneath the surface mixes with water. This forms gases. The gas pressure grows until it must be released. The volcano erupts in an enormous explosion. Ash and particles shoot many kilometers into the sky. The material may form a mushroom cloud, just like a nuclear explosion. Hot fragments of rock, called pyroclasts, fly up into the air at very high speeds. The pyroclasts cool in the atmosphere. Some ash may stay in the atmosphere for years. The ash may block out sunlight. This changes weather patterns and affects the temperature of the Earth. For a year or two after a large eruption, sunsets may be especially beautiful worldwide. Volcanic gases can form poisonous, invisible clouds. The poisonous gases may be toxic close to the eruption. The gases may cause environmental problems like acid rain and ozone destruction. Mt St. Helens was not a very large eruption for the Cascades. Mt. Mazama blew itself apart in an eruption about 42 times more powerful than Mount St. Helens in 1980. Today all that remains of that huge stratovolcano is Crater Lake (Figure 8.18).

Answer:",C
516,"Context: Magma forms deep beneath the Earths surface. Rock melts below the surface under tremendous pressure and high temperatures. Molten rock flows like taffy or hot wax. Most magmas are formed at temperatures between 600o C and 1300o C (Figure 8.8). Magma collects in magma chambers beneath Earths surface. Magma chambers are located where the heat and pressure are great enough to melt rock. These locations are at divergent or convergent plate boundaries or at hotpots. The chemistry of a magma determines the type of igneous rock it forms. The chemistry also determines how the magma moves. Thicker magmas tend to stay below the surface or erupt explosively. When magma is fluid and runny, it often reaches the surface by flowing out in rivers of lava. 
Question: For magma to form, solid rock must reach a temperature of at least
Options:(A) 600 C (B) 1600 C (C) 6000 C (D) 16 (E) 000 C

518,"Context: Prior to the Mount St. Helens eruption in 1980, the Lassen Peak eruption on May 22, 1915, was the most recent Cascades eruption. A column of ash and gas shot 30,000 feet into the air. This triggered a high-speed pyroclastic flow, which melted snow and created a volcanic mudflow known as a lahar. Lassen Peak currently has geothermal activity and could erupt explosively again. Mt. Shasta, the other active volcano in California, erupts every 600 to 800 years. An eruption would most likely create a large pyroclastic flow, and probably a lahar. Of course, Mt. Shasta could explode and collapse like Mt. Mazama in Oregon (Figure 1.4). Crater Lake fills the caldera of the col- lapsed Mt. Mazama, which erupted with 42 times more power than Mount St. He- lens in 1980. The bathymetry of the lake shows volcanic features such as cinder cones.

529,"Context: Some volcanic eruptions are non-explosive (Figure 8.7). This happens when there is little or no gas. The lava is thin, fluid and runny. It flows over the ground like a river. People generally have a lot of warning before a lava flow like this reaches them, so non-explosive eruptions are much less deadly. They may still be destructive to property, though. Even when we know that a lava flow is approaching, there are few ways of stopping it! 
Question: A volcano is more likely to be explosive when lava is thin and runny.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
530,"Context: Low-viscosity lava flows down mountainsides. Differences in composition and where the lavas erupt result in three types of lava flow coming from effusive eruptions. Aa lava forms a thick and brittle crust that is torn into rough and jagged pieces. Aa lava can spread over large areas as the lava continues to flow underneath the crusts surface. Pahoehoe lava forms lava tubes where fluid lava flows through the outer cooled rock crust. Pahoehoe lava is less viscous than aa lava, so its surface looks is smooth and ropy. Mafic lava that erupts underwater creates pillow lava. The lava cools very quickly, forming roughly spherical rocks. Pillow lava is common at mid-ocean ridges (Figure (a) Aa lava spread over large areas. (b) Pahoehoe lava tubes where at the Thurston Lava Tube in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. (c) Pahoehoe lava is less viscous than aa lava so its surface looks is smooth and ropy. (d) Pillow lava. 
Question: When aa lava cools, it forms lava tubes.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
531,"Context: Remember that the mid-ocean ridge is where hot mantle material upwells in a convection cell. The upwelling mantle melts due to pressure release to form lava. Lava flows at the surface cool rapidly to become basalt, but deeper in the crust, magma cools more slowly to form gabbro. The entire ridge system is made up of igneous rock that is either extrusive or intrusive. The seafloor is also igneous rock with some sediment that has fallen onto it. Earthquakes are common at mid-ocean ridges since the movement of magma and oceanic crust results in crustal shaking. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:

536,"Context: The erupted rock fragments are called tephra. Ash and gas also explode from the volcano. Scorching hot tephra, ash, and gas may speed down the volcanos slopes at 700 km/h (450 mph) as a pyroclastic flow. Pyroclastic means fire rock (Figure 1.2). Left: An explosive eruption from the Mayon Volcano in the Philippines in 1984. Ash flies upward into the sky and pyroclastic flows pour down the mountainside. Right: The end of a pyroclastic flow at Mount St. Helens. Pyroclastic flows knock down everything in their path. The temperature inside a pyroclastic flow may be as high as 1,000 C (1,800 F). Blowdown of trees near Mount St. Helens shows the direction of the blast and pyro- clastic flow.

Answer:",F
538,"Context: Mafic magma creates gentler effusive eruptions. Although the pressure builds enough for the magma to erupt, it does not erupt with the same explosive force as felsic magma. Magma pushes toward the surface through fissures. Eventually, the magma reaches the surface and erupts through a vent (Figure 1.1). Effusive eruptions are common in Hawaii, where lavas are mafic. In effusive eruptions, lava flows readily, producing rivers of molten rock. A Quicktime movie with thermal camera of a lava stream within the vent of a Hawaiian volcano is seen here:

539,"Context: Scientists study a volcanos history to try to predict when it will next erupt. They want to know how long it has been since it last erupted. They also want to know the time span between its previous eruptions. Volcanoes can be active, dormant, or extinct (Figure 8.12). An active volcano may be currently erupting. Alter- natively, it may be showing signs that it will erupt in the near future. A dormant volcano no longer shows signs of activity. But it has erupted in recent history and will probably erupt again. An extinct volcano is one that has not erupted in recent history. Scientists think that it will probably not erupt again. Scientists watch both active and dormant volcanoes closely for signs that show they might erupt.

Answer:",D
542,"Context: Cinder cones are the most common type of volcano. A cinder cone has a cone shape, but is much smaller than a composite volcano. Cinder cones rarely reach 300 meters in height, but they have steep sides. Cinder cones grow rapidly, usually from a single eruption cycle. These volcanoes usually flank shield or composite volcanoes. Many cinder cones are found in Hawaii. A lava fountain erupts from Puu Oo, a cinder cone on Kilauea.

543,"Context: Figure 8.14 shows Mt. Fuji, a classic example of a composite volcano. Composite volcanoes have broad bases and steep sides. These volcanoes usually have a large crater at the top. The crater was created during the volcanos last eruption. Composite volcanoes are also called stratovolcanoes. This is because they are formed by alternating layers (strata) of magma and ash (Figure 8.15). The magma that creates composite volcanoes tends to be thick. The steep sides form because the lava cannot flow too far from the vent. The thick magma may also create explosive eruptions. Ash and pyroclasts erupt into the air. Much of this material falls back down near the vent. This creates the steep sides of stratovolcanoes. Composite volcanoes are common along convergent plate boundaries. When a tectonic plate subducts, it melts. This creates the thick magma needed for these eruptions. The Pacific Ring of Fire is dotted by composite volcanoes.

Answer:",D
550,"Context: An explosive eruption produces huge clouds of volcanic ash. Chunks of the volcano fly high into the atmosphere. Explosive eruptions can be 10,000 times as powerful as an atomic bomb (Figure 8.6). Hot magma beneath the surface mixes with water. This forms gases. The gas pressure grows until it must be released. The volcano erupts in an enormous explosion. Ash and particles shoot many kilometers into the sky. The material may form a mushroom cloud, just like a nuclear explosion. Hot fragments of rock, called pyroclasts, fly up into the air at very high speeds. The pyroclasts cool in the atmosphere. Some ash may stay in the atmosphere for years. The ash may block out sunlight. This changes weather patterns and affects the temperature of the Earth. For a year or two after a large eruption, sunsets may be especially beautiful worldwide. Volcanic gases can form poisonous, invisible clouds. The poisonous gases may be toxic close to the eruption. The gases may cause environmental problems like acid rain and ozone destruction. Mt St. Helens was not a very large eruption for the Cascades. Mt. Mazama blew itself apart in an eruption about 42 times more powerful than Mount St. Helens in 1980.

552,"Context: Shield volcanoes look like a huge ancient warriors shield laid down. Figure 8.16 shows the Kilaeua Volcano. A shield volcano has a very wide base. It is much flatter on the top than a composite volcano. The lava that creates shield volcanoes is reltively thin. The thin lava spreads out. This builds a large, flat volcano layer by layer. Shield volcanoes are very large. For example, the Mauna Loa Volcano has a diameter of more than 112 kilometers (70 miles). The volcano forms a significant part of the island of Hawaii. The top of nearby Mauna Kea Volcano is more than ten kilometers (6 miles) from its base on the seafloor. Shield volcanoes often form along divergent plate boundaries. They also form at hot spots, like Hawaii. Shield volcano eruptions are non-explosive.

This blocks the Sun and lowers the temperature of the entire planet. The result is a volcanic winter. A supervolcano eruption took place at Lake Toba in northern Sumatra about 75,000 years ago (Figure 8.19). This was the largest eruption in the past 25 million years. As much as 2,800 cubic kilometers of material was ejected into the atmosphere. The result was a 6- to 10-year volcanic winter. Some scientists think that only 10,000 humans survived worldwide. The numbers of other mammals also plummeted. The most recent supervolcano eruption was in New Zealand. The eruption was less than 2000 years ago. For a supervolcano eruption it was small, about 100 cubic kilometers of material. A much larger super eruption in Colorado produced over 5,000 cubic kilometers of material. That eruption was 28 million years ago. It was 5000 times larger than the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption. The largest potentially active supervolcano in North America is Yellowstone. The caldera has had three super eruptions at 2.1 million, 1.3 million and 640,000 years ago. The floor of the Yellowstone caldera is slowly rising upwards. Another eruption is very likely but no one knows when. The cause of supervolcano eruptions is being debated. Enormous magma chambers are filled with super hot magma. This enormous eruption leaves a huge hole. The ground collapses and creates a caldera. 
Question: A supervolcano
Options:(A) is the most dangerous type of volcano (B) may cause Earths temperature to rise (C) has no magma chamber (D) produces no ash
Answer:",A
562,"Context: Since the early Earth was very hot, mantle convection was very rapid. Plate tectonics likely moved very quickly. The early Earth was a very active place with abundant volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. The remnants of these early rocks are now seen in the ancient cores of the continents. 
Question: Supervolcanoes only erupted early in Earth history when the planet was hotter.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
563,"Context: Volcanic mountain ranges form when oceanic crust is pushed down into the mantle at convergent plate boundaries. The Andes Mountains are a chain of coastal volcanic mountains. They are forming as the Nazca plate subducts beneath the South American plate (Figure 7.18). 
Question: A volcanic mountain is a mountain that forms when magma is forced upward and flows onto Earths
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
564,"Context: Figure 8.14 shows Mt. Fuji, a classic example of a composite volcano. Composite volcanoes have broad bases and steep sides. These volcanoes usually have a large crater at the top. The crater was created during the volcanos last eruption. Composite volcanoes are also called stratovolcanoes. This is because they are formed by alternating layers (strata) of magma and ash (Figure 8.15). The magma that creates composite volcanoes tends to be thick. The steep sides form because the lava cannot flow too far from the vent. The thick magma may also create explosive eruptions. Ash and pyroclasts erupt into the air. Much of this material falls back down near the vent. This creates the steep sides of stratovolcanoes. Composite volcanoes are common along convergent plate boundaries. When a tectonic plate subducts, it melts. This creates the thick magma needed for these eruptions. The Pacific Ring of Fire is dotted by composite volcanoes. 
Question: Many composite volcanoes are found in the Pacific Ring of Fire.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
565,"Context: The erupted rock fragments are called tephra. Ash and gas also explode from the volcano. Scorching hot tephra, ash, and gas may speed down the volcanos slopes at 700 km/h (450 mph) as a pyroclastic flow. Pyroclastic means fire rock (Figure 1.2). Left: An explosive eruption from the Mayon Volcano in the Philippines in 1984. Ash flies upward into the sky and pyroclastic flows pour down the mountainside. Right: The end of a pyroclastic flow at Mount St. Helens. Pyroclastic flows knock down everything in their path. The temperature inside a pyroclastic flow may be as high as 1,000 C (1,800 F). Blowdown of trees near Mount St. Helens shows the direction of the blast and pyro- clastic flow. 
Question: All volcanoes release ashes, gases, and pyroclasts.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
566,"Context: Viscous lava cannot travel far down the sides of the volcano before it solidifies, which creates the steep slopes of a composite volcano. In some eruptions the pressure builds up so much that the material explodes as ash and small rocks. The volcano is constructed layer by layer, as ash and lava solidify, one upon the other (Figure 1.3). The result is the classic cone shape of composite volcanoes. Mount St. Helens was a beautiful, classic, cone-shaped volcano. In May 1980 the volcano blew its top off in an explosive eruption, losing 1,300 feet off its summit. Mt. Fuji in Japan is one of the worlds most easily recognized composite volca- noes. 
Question: Composite volcanoes have steep sides because the lava cannot flow very far.
Options:(A) true (B) false

Question: Mauna Loa in Hawaii is an example of a composite volcano.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
568,"Context: Shield volcanoes look like a huge ancient warriors shield laid down. Figure 8.16 shows the Kilaeua Volcano. A shield volcano has a very wide base. It is much flatter on the top than a composite volcano. The lava that creates shield volcanoes is reltively thin. The thin lava spreads out. This builds a large, flat volcano layer by layer. Shield volcanoes are very large. For example, the Mauna Loa Volcano has a diameter of more than 112 kilometers (70 miles). The volcano forms a significant part of the island of Hawaii. The top of nearby Mauna Kea Volcano is more than ten kilometers (6 miles) from its base on the seafloor. Shield volcanoes often form along divergent plate boundaries. They also form at hot spots, like Hawaii. Shield volcano eruptions are non-explosive. 
Question: A shield volcano has a flatter top than a composite volcano.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
569,"Context: Cinder cones are the smallest and most common type of volcano. Cinder cones have steep sides like composite volcanoes. But they are much smaller, rarely reaching even 300 meters in height. Cinder cones usually have a crater at the summit. Cinder cones are composed of small fragments of rock, called cinders. The cinders are piled on top of one another. These volcanoes usually do not produce streams of lava. Cinder cones often form near larger volcanoes. Most composite and shield volcanoes have nearby cinder cones. Cinder cones usually build up very rapidly. They only erupt for a short time. Many only produce one eruption. For this reason, cinder cones do not reach the sizes of stratovolcanoes or shield volcanoes (Figure 8.17).

Question: The largest supervolcano in North America is Yellowstone.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
574,"Context: Climate is the most important factor in soil formation. The climate of a region is the result of its temperature and rainfall. We can identify different climates by the plants that grow there (Figure 9.6). Given enough time, a climate will produce a particular type of soil. The original rock type does not matter. The same rock type will form a different soil type in each different climate. Rainfall Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering. Temperature The temperature of a region is the other important part of climate. The rate of chemical reactions increases with higher temperatures. The rate doubles for every 10 C increase in temperature. Plants and bacteria grow and multiply faster in warmer areas. 
Question: Factors that influence soil formation in a region include
Options:(A) average temperature (B) amount of rainfall (C) type of bedrock (D) all of the above
Answer:",D
575,"Context: Called the A-horizon, the topsoil is usually the darkest layer of the soil because it has the highest proportion of organic material. The topsoil is the region of most intense biological activity: insects, worms, and other animals burrow through it and plants stretch their roots down into it. Plant roots help to hold this layer of soil in place. In the topsoil, minerals may dissolve in the fresh water that moves through it to be carried to lower layers of the soil. Very small particles, such as clay, may also get carried to lower layers as water seeps down into the ground. 
Question: Topsoil is dark in color because it
Options:(A) undergoes a lot of chemical weathering (B) has a large amount of organic material (C) is full of dark rocks (D) contains a lot of worms
Answer:",B
576,"Context: Biological activity produces the organic material in soil. Humus forms from the remains of plants and animals. It is an extremely important part of the soil. Humus coats the mineral grains. It binds them together into clumps that hold the soil together. This gives the soil its structure. Soils with high humus are better able to hold water. Soils rich with organic materials hold nutrients better and are more fertile. These soils are more easily farmed. The color of soil indicates its fertility. Black or dark brown soils are rich in nitrogen and contain a high percentage of organic materials. Soils that are nitrogen poor and low in organic material might be gray, yellow, or red. 
Question: How does humus affect soil?
Options:(A) It prevents soil from holding water (B) It binds together mineral particles in soil (C) It reduces the nitrogen content of soil (D) It makes soil less fertile for plant growth
Answer:",B
577,"Context: One important type of soil forms in a deciduous forest. In these forests, trees lose their leaves each winter. Deciduous trees need lots of rain  at least 65 cm of rainfall per year. Deciduous forests are common in the temperate, eastern United States. The type of soil found in a deciduous forest is a pedalfer (Figure 9.10). This type of soil is usually dark brown or black in color and very fertile. 
Question: In the eastern U.S., high rainfall and deciduous forests have soils called
Options:(A) pedocal (B) laterite (C) pedalfers (D) weathered soil
Answer:",C
578,"Context: The inorganic part of soil is made of different amounts of different size particles. This affects the characteristics of a soil. Water flows through soil more easily if the spaces between the particles are large enough and well connected. Sandy or silty soils are light soils because they drain water. Soils rich in clay are heavier. Clay particles allow only very small spaces between them, so clay-rich soils tend to hold water. Clay-rich soils are heavier and hold together more tightly. A soil that contains a mixture of grain sizes is called a loam. Soil scientists measure the percentage of sand, silt, and clay in soil. They plot this information on a triangular diagram, with each type of particle at one corner (Figure 9.7). The soil type is determined by where the soil falls on the diagram. At the top, the soil is clay rich. On the left corner, the soil is sandy. On the right corner, the soil is silty. 
Question: Which size of rock particles in soil causes soil to hold the most water?
Options:(A) gravel (B) clay (C) sand (D) silt
Answer:",B
579,"Context: Adding organic material to the soil in the form of plant or animal waste, such as compost or manure, increases the fertility of the soil and improves its ability to hold on to water and nutrients (Figure 1.2). Inorganic fertilizer can also temporarily increase the fertility of a soil and may be less expensive or time consuming, but it does not provide the same long-term improvements as organic materials. 
Question: Adding organic material to soil
Options:(A) allows it to contain water and nutrients (B) decreases its fertility (C) increases its A horizon (D) often kills existing vegetation
Answer:",A
580,"Context: Soil is a natural resource that is vitally important for sustaining natural habitats and for growing food. Although soil is a renewable resource, it is renewed slowly, taking hundreds or thousands of years for a good fertile soil to develop. Organic material can be added to soil to help increase its fertility. Most of the best land for farming is already being cultivated. With human populations continuing to grow, it is extremely important to protect our soil resources. Agricultural practices such as rotating crops, alternating the types of crops planted in each row, and planting nutrient-rich cover crops all help to keep soil more fertile as it is used season after season. Planting trees as windbreaks, plowing along contours of the field, or building terraces into steeper slopes will all help to hold soil in place (Figure 1.3). No-till or low-tillage farming helps to keep soil in place by disturbing the ground as little as possible when planting. Steep slopes can be terraced to make level planting areas and decrease surface water runoff and erosion. The rate of topsoil loss in the United States and other developed countries has decreased recently as better farming practices have been adopted. Unfortunately, in developing nations, soil is often not protected. Table 1.1 shows some steps that we can take to prevent erosion. Some are things that can be done by farmers or developers. Others are things that individual homeowners or community members can implement locally. Source of Erosion Strategies for Prevention Leave leaf litter on the ground in the winter. Grow cover crops, special crops grown in the winter to cover the soil. Plant tall trees around fields to buffer the effects of wind. Drive tractors as little as possible. Use drip irrigation that puts small amounts of water in the ground frequently. Avoid watering crops with sprinklers that make big water drops on the ground. Keep fields as flat as possible to avoid soil erod- ing down hill. Grazing Animals Move animals throughout the year, so they dont consume all the vegetation in one spot. Keep animals away from stream banks, where hills are especially prone to erosion. Logging and Mining Reduce the amount of land that is logged and mined. Reduce the number of roads that are built to access logging areas. Avoid logging and mining on steep lands. Cut only small areas at one time and quickly replant logged areas with new seedlings. Development Reduce the amount of land area that is developed into urban areas, parking lots, etc. Keep as much green space in cities as possible, such as parks or strips where plants can grow. Invest in and use new technologies for parking lots that make them permeable to water in order to reduce runoff of water. Recreational Activities Avoid using off-road vehicles on hilly lands. Stay on designated trails. Avoid building on steep hills. Grade surrounding land to distribute water rather than collecting it in one place. Where water collects, drain to creeks and rivers.

581,"Context: The first horizon is the A horizon. It is more commonly called the topsoil. The topsoil is usually the darkest layer of the soil. It is the layer with the most organic material. Humus forms from all the plant and animal debris that falls to or grows on the ground. The topsoil is also the region with the most biological activity. Many organisms live within this layer. Plant roots stretch down into this layer. The roots help to hold the topsoil in place. Topsoil usually does not have very small particles like clay. Clay-sized particles are carried to lower layers as water seeps down into the ground. Many minerals dissolve in the fresh water that moves through the topsoil. These minerals are carried down to the lower layers of soil.

583,"Context: The original rock is the source of the inorganic portion of the soil. The minerals that are present in the rock determine the composition of the material that is available to make soil. Soils may form in place or from material that has been moved. Residual soils form in place. The underlying rock breaks down to form the layers of soil that reside above it. Only about one-third of the soils in the United States are residual. Transported soils have been transported in from somewhere else. Sediments can be transported into an area by glaciers, wind, water, or gravity. Soils form from the loose particles that have been transported to a new location and deposited.

586,"Context: Weather makes life interesting. Weather also causes weathering. Weathering is the slow wearing down of rocks on Earths surface. Wind-blown sand scours rocks like sandpaper. Glaciers of ice scrape across rock surfaces like a file. Even gentle rain may seep into rocks and slowly dissolve them. If the water freezes, it expands. This eventually causes the rocks to crack.

588,"Context: Soil formation requires weathering. Where there is less weathering, soils are thinner. However, soluble minerals may be present. Where there is intense weathering, soils may be thick. Minerals and nutrients would have been washed out. Soil development takes a very long time. It may take hundreds or even thousands of years to form the fertile upper layer of soil. Soil scientists estimate that in the very best soil forming conditions, soil forms at a rate of about 1mm/year. In poor conditions, it may take thousands of years! How well soil forms and what type of soil forms depends on many factors. These include climate, the original rock type, the slope, the amount of time, and biological activity. 
Question: The average rate of soil formation is about 1 cm/year.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
589,"Context: The steeper the slope, the less likely material will be able to stay in place to form soil. Material on a steep slope is likely to go downhill. Materials will accumulate and soil will form where land areas are flat or gently undulating.

591,"Context: In tropical rainforests where it rains literally every day, laterite soils form (Figure 1.4). In these hot, wet, tropical regions, intense chemical weathering strips the soils of their nutrients. There is practically no humus. All soluble minerals are removed from the soil and all plant nutrients are carried away. All that is left behind are the least soluble materials, like aluminum and iron oxides. These soils are often red in color from the iron oxides. Laterite soils bake as hard as a brick if they are exposed to the Sun. A laterite is the type of thick, nutrient-poor soil that forms in the rainforest. Many climate types have not been mentioned here.

594,"Context: We can think about soil as a living resource. Soil is an ecosystem all by itself! Soil is a complex mixture of different materials. Some of them are inorganic. Inorganic materials are made from non-living substances like pebbles and sand. Soil also contains bits of organic materials from plants and animals. In general, about half of the soil is made of pieces of rock and minerals. The other half is organic materials. In the spaces of soil are millions of living organisms. These include earthworms, ants, bacteria, and fungi. In some soils, the organic portion is entirely missing. This is true of desert sand. At the other extreme, a soil may be completely organic. Peat, found in a bog or swamp, is totally organic soil. Organic materials are necessary for a soil to be fertile. The organic portion provides the nutrients needed for strong plant growth.

It is a drier region with less vegetation, so the soils have lower amounts of organic material and are less fertile. A pedocal is named for the calcite enriched layer that forms. Water begins to move down through the soil layers, but before it gets very far, it begins to evaporate. Soluble minerals, like calcium carbonate, concentrate in a layer that marks the lowest place that water was able to reach. This layer is called caliche.

600,"Context: There are many ways to protect soil. We can add organic material like manure or compost. This increases the soils fertility. Increased fertility improves the soils ability to hold water and nutrients. Inorganic fertilizers also increase fertility. These fertilizers are less expensive than natural fertilizers, but they do not provide the same long term benefits. Careful farming helps to keep up soil quality each season. One way is to plant different crops each year. Another is to alternate the crops planted in each row of the field. These techniques preserve and replenish soil nutrients. Planting nutrient rich cover crops helps the soil. Planting trees as windbreaks, plowing along contours of a field, or building terraces into steeper slopes all help to hold soil in place (Figure 9.14).

603,"Context: The first horizon is the A horizon. It is more commonly called the topsoil. The topsoil is usually the darkest layer of the soil. It is the layer with the most organic material. Humus forms from all the plant and animal debris that falls to or grows on the ground. The topsoil is also the region with the most biological activity. Many organisms live within this layer. Plant roots stretch down into this layer. The roots help to hold the topsoil in place. Topsoil usually does not have very small particles like clay. Clay-sized particles are carried to lower layers as water seeps down into the ground. Many minerals dissolve in the fresh water that moves through the topsoil. These minerals are carried down to the lower layers of soil. 
Question: common name for soil horizon A
Options:(A) humus (B) laterite (C) topsoil (D) pedocal (E) subsoil (F) soil profile (G) pedalfer
Answer:",C
604,"Context: A third important type of soil is laterite. Laterite forms in tropical areas. Temperatures are warm and rain falls every day (Figure 9.12). So much rain falls that chemical weathering is intense. All soluble minerals are washed from the soil. Plant nutrients get leached or carried away. There is practically no humus. Laterite soils are often red in color from the iron oxides. If laterites are exposed to the Sun, they bake as hard as a brick. 
Question: type of soil found in tropical areas
Options:(A) humus (B) laterite (C) topsoil (D) pedocal (E) subsoil (F) soil profile (G) pedalfer
Answer:",B
605,"Context: We can think about soil as a living resource. Soil is an ecosystem all by itself! Soil is a complex mixture of different materials. Some of them are inorganic. Inorganic materials are made from non-living substances like pebbles and sand. Soil also contains bits of organic materials from plants and animals. In general, about half of the soil is made of pieces of rock and minerals. The other half is organic materials. In the spaces of soil are millions of living organisms. These include earthworms, ants, bacteria, and fungi. In some soils, the organic portion is entirely missing. This is true of desert sand. At the other extreme, a soil may be completely organic. Peat, found in a bog or swamp, is totally organic soil. Organic materials are necessary for a soil to be fertile. The organic portion provides the nutrients needed for strong plant growth. 
Question: organic material in soil
Options:(A) humus (B) laterite (C) topsoil (D) pedocal (E) subsoil (F) soil profile (G) pedalfer
Answer:",A
606,"Context: One important type of soil forms in a deciduous forest. In these forests, trees lose their leaves each winter. Deciduous trees need lots of rain  at least 65 cm of rainfall per year. Deciduous forests are common in the temperate, eastern United States. The type of soil found in a deciduous forest is a pedalfer (Figure 9.10). This type of soil is usually dark brown or black in color and very fertile. 
Question: type of soil found in deciduous forests
Options:(A) humus (B) laterite (C) topsoil (D) pedocal (E) subsoil (F) soil profile (G) pedalfer
Answer:",G
607,"Context: Soil develops over time and forms soil horizons. Soil horizons are different layers of soil with depth. The most weathering occurs in the top layer. This layer is most exposed to weather! It is where fresh water comes into contact with the soil. Each layer lower is weathered just a little bit less than the layer above. As water moves down through the layers, it is able to do less work to change the soil. If you dig a deep hole in the ground, you may see each of the different layers of soil. All together, the layers are a soil profile. Each horizon has its own set of characteristics (Figure 9.8). In the simplest soil profile, a soil has three horizons. 
Question: all the layers of a particular soil
Options:(A) humus (B) laterite (C) topsoil (D) pedocal (E) subsoil (F) soil profile (G) pedalfer
Answer:",F
608,"Context: Its very important to control wind erosion of soil. Good soil is a precious resource that takes a long time to form. Covering soil with plants is one way to reduce wind erosion. Plants and their roots help hold the soil in place. They also help the soil retain water so it is less likely to blow away. Planting rows of trees around fields is another way to reduce wind erosion. The trees slow down the wind, so it doesnt cause as much erosion. Fences like the one in Figure 10.26 serve the same purpose. The fence in the figure is preventing erosion and migration of sand dunes on a beach. 
Question: how does terracing prevent soil erosion?
Options:(A) Keeps soil from moving very far downhill (B) Slows the speed of water (C) Removes vegetation (D) which slows erosion (E) d A & B
Answer:",D
609,"Context: The Dust Bowl taught people that soil could be lost by plowing and growing crops. This led to the development of new ways of farming that help protect the soil. Some of the methods are described in Figure 19.6. 
Question: developed nations have improved farming practices to protect topsoil.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",A
610,"Context: The photos in Figure 19.2 show how farming practices can increase soil erosion. Plant roots penetrate the soil and keep it from eroding. Plowing turns over bare soil and cuts through plant roots. Bare soil is exposed to wind and water. In the past, farmers always plowed fields before planting. Some farmers now use no-till farming, which does not disturb the soil as much. The problem doesnt stop with plowing. Crops are usually planted in rows, with bare soil in between the rows. In places where crops grow only during part of the year, the land may be bare for a few months. 
Question: which is not an example of an agricultural practice that helps prevent soil erosion?
Options:(A) Crop rotation (B) Monoculture crops (C) Alternating the types of crops planted in each row (D) Planting nutrient-rich cover crops
Answer:",B
611,"Context: Soil is a complex mixture of different materials. About half of most soils are inorganic materials, such as the products of weathered rock, including pebbles, sand, silt, and clay particles. About half of all soils are organic materials, formed from the partial breakdown and decomposition of plants and animals. The organic materials are necessary for a soil to be fertile. The organic portion provides the nutrients, such as nitrogen, needed for strong plant growth. In between the solid pieces, there are tiny spaces filled with air and water. Within the soil layer, important reactions between solid rock, liquid water, air, and living things take place. In some soils, the organic portion could be missing, as in desert sand. Or a soil could be completely organic, such as the materials that make up peat in a bog or swamp (Figure 1.1). 
Question: soil is
Options:(A) A renewable resource that takes a short amount of time to develop (B) A renewable resource (C) but it takes a really long amount of time to develop (D) c A nonrenewable resource (E) d Not a resource
Answer:",B
612,"Context: Logging removes trees that protect the ground from soil erosion. The tree roots hold the soil together and the tree canopy protects the soil from hard falling rain. Logging results in the loss of leaf litter, or dead leaves, bark, and branches on the forest floor. Leaf litter plays an important role in protecting forest soils from erosion (Figure 1.3). Logging exposes large areas of land to erosion. Much of the worlds original forests have been logged. Many of the tropical forests that remain are currently the site of logging because North America and Europe have already harvested many of their trees (Figure 1.4). Soils eroded from logged forests clog rivers and lakes, fill estuaries, and bury coral reefs. Surface mining disturbs the land (Figure 1.5) and leaves the soil vulnerable to erosion. 
Question: how can loggers reduce the amount of soil erosion?
Options:(A) Avoid logging on steep lands (B) Cut only small areas at one time (C) Replant logged areas with new seedlings (D) All of the above
Answer:",D
613,"Context: Other human actions that put soil at risk include logging, mining, and construction. You can see examples of each in Figure 19.4. When forests are cut down, the soil is suddenly exposed to wind and rain. Without trees, there is no leaf litter to cover the ground and protect the soil. When leaf litter decays, it adds humus and nutrients to the soil. Mining and construction strip soil off the ground and leave the land bare. Paved roads and parking lots prevent rainwater from soaking into the ground. This increases runoff and the potential for soil erosion. 
Question: which of the following will not damage soils?
Options:(A) Salt accumulation (B) Returning a landscape to its native vegetation (C) Exposing soil to the elements (D) Drought
Answer:",B
614,"Context: The Dust Bowl taught people that soil could be lost by plowing and growing crops. This led to the development of new ways of farming that help protect the soil. Some of the methods are described in Figure 19.6. 
Question: the single cause of the dust bowl was
Options:(A) Bad farming practices (B) A drought (C) A return to normal rainfall patterns (D) There was no single cause of the Dust Bowl
Answer:",D
615,"Context: There are many ways to protect soil. We can add organic material like manure or compost. This increases the soils fertility. Increased fertility improves the soils ability to hold water and nutrients. Inorganic fertilizers also increase fertility. These fertilizers are less expensive than natural fertilizers, but they do not provide the same long term benefits. Careful farming helps to keep up soil quality each season. One way is to plant different crops each year. Another is to alternate the crops planted in each row of the field. These techniques preserve and replenish soil nutrients. Planting nutrient rich cover crops helps the soil. Planting trees as windbreaks, plowing along contours of a field, or building terraces into steeper slopes all help to hold soil in place (Figure 9.14). No-till or low-till farming disturbs the ground as little as possible during planting. 
Question: the best way to fertilize soil is to
Options:(A) Use inorganic fertilizer (B) which is less expensive (C) b Use compost (D) which protects the soil from holding too much water (E) c Use manure (F) which adds back nutrients (G) d Use nitrogen and phosphorous (H) which provides long-term improvements in soil

Options:(A) Include green spaces because plants absorb water (B) Cover the region with as much concrete as possible to protect the soil beneath (C) Keep pets on sidewalks so they don’t trample the grass (D) None of these
Answer:",A
617,"Context: Even things that people do for fun can expose soil to erosion. For example, overuse of hiking trails can leave bare patches of soil. Off-road vehicles cause even more damage. You can see examples of this in Figure 19.5. 
Question: off-road vehicles and people hiking off of trails can cause significant erosion.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",A
618,"Context: The Cenozoic began around 65.5 million years ago and continues today. Although it accounts for only about 1.5% of the Earths total history, as the most recent era it is the one scientists know the most about. Much of what has been discussed elsewhere in CK-12 Earth Science Concepts For High School describes the geological situation of the Cenozoic. A few highlights are mentioned here. 
Question: the cenozoic era is defined ad beginning when
Options:(A) The dinosaurs and other organisms went extinct at the end of the Mesozoic (B) Pangaea broke up (C) The ice ages began (D) Vertebrates (E) such as fish (F) amphibians (G) reptiles and birds evolved
Answer:",A
619,"Context: The paleogeography of the era was very much like it is today. Early in the Cenozoic, blocks of crust uplifted to form the Rocky Mountains, which were later eroded away and then uplifted again. Subduction off of the Pacific Northwest formed the Cascades volcanic arc. The Basin and Range province that centers on Nevada is where crust is being pulled apart. 
Question: early in the cenozoic, blocks of crust uplifted to make this mountain range.
Options:(A) The Appalachians (B) Himalayas (C) The Alps (D) The Rocky Mountains
Answer:",D
620,"Context: Subduction of oceanic lithosphere at convergent plate boundaries also builds mountain ranges. This happens on continental crust, as in the Andes Mountains (Figure 1.2), or on oceanic crust, as with the Aleutian Islands, which we visited earlier. The Cascades Mountains of the western U.S. are also created this way. The Andes Mountains are a chain of con- tinental arc volcanoes that build up as the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South American Plate. 
Question: subduction off of the pacific northwest creates this mountain range.
Options:(A) The Rocky Mountains (B) The San Andreas (C) The Cascades (D) None of the above
Answer:",C
621,"Context: The San Andreas Fault has grown where the Pacific and North American plates meet. The plate tectonic evolution of that plate boundary is complex and interesting (Figure 1.1). The Farallon Plate was subducting beneath the North American Plate 30 Ma. By 20 Ma the Pacific Plate and East Pacific Rise spreading center had started to subduct, splitting the Farallon Plate into two smaller plates. Transform motion where the Pacific and North American plates meet formed the San Andreas Fault. The fault moved inland and at present small sea floor spreading basins along with the transform motion of the San Andreas are splitting Baja California from mainland Mexico. This figure shows the evolution of the San Andreas Fault zone from 30 million years ago (bottom) to present (top). Although most plate tectonic activity involves continents moving apart, smaller regions are coming together. Africa collided with Eurasia to create the Alps.

Answer:",D
622,"Context: The moving continents collided with island arcs and microcontinents so that mountain ranges accreted onto the continents edges. The subduction of the oceanic Farallon plate beneath western North America during the late In the Afar Region of Ethiopia, Africa is splitting apart. Three plates are pulling away from a central point. Jurassic and early Cretaceous produced igneous intrusions and other structures. The intrusions have since been uplifted so that they are exposed in the Sierra Nevada Mountains (Figure 1.2).

Question: africa collided with ____________ to create the alps.
Options:(A) India (B) Eurasia (C) Antarctica (D) All of the above
Answer:",B
623,"Context: Earths crust consists of many tectonic plates that move over time. Due to plate tectonics, the continents changed their shapes and positions during Earth history. As the continents changed, so did the oceans. About 250 million years ago, there was one huge land mass known as Pangaea. There was also one huge ocean called Panthalassa. You can see it in Figure 14.2. By 180 million years ago, Pangaea began to break up. The continents started to drift apart. They slowly moved to where they are today. The movement of the continents caused Panthalassa to break into smaller oceans. These oceans are now known as the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic Oceans. The waters of all the oceans are connected. 
Question: when plate motions separated australia and antarctica,
Options:(A) The Antarctic Circumpolar Current was free to circle Antarctica (B) The Pleistocene ice ages began (C) Surface ocean currents took on an entirely north south direction of motion (D) All of these
Answer:",A
624,"Context: As the continents moved apart, climate began to cool. When Australia and Antarctica separated, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current could then move the frigid water around Antarctica and spread it more widely around the planet. Antarctica drifted over the south polar region and the continent began to grow a permanent ice cap in the Oligocene. The climate warmed in the early Miocene but then began to cool again in the late Miocene and Pliocene when glaciers began to form. During the Pleistocene ice ages, which began 2.6 million years ago, glaciers advanced and retreated four times (Figure 1.2). During the retreats, the climate was often warmer than it is today. Glacial ice at its maximum during the Pleistocene. These continental ice sheets were extremely thick, like the Antarctic ice cap is today. The Pleistocene ice ages guided the evolution of life in the Cenozoic, including the evolution of humans. 
Question: when antarctica drifted over the south polar region,

Answer:",C
625,"Context: Humans evolved during the later Cenozoic. New fossil discoveries alter the details of what we know about the evolution of modern humans, but the major evolutionary path is well understood. 
Question: much of human evolution took place during the
Options:(A) Miocene (B) Pleistocene (C) Oligocene (D) Eocene
Answer:",B
626,"Context: At the end of the Paleozoic there was one continent and one ocean. When Pangaea began to break apart about 180 million years ago, the Panthalassa Ocean separated into the individual but interconnected oceans that we see today on Earth. The Atlantic Ocean basin formed as Pangaea split apart. The seafloor spreading that pushed Africa and South America apart is continuing to enlarge the Atlantic Ocean (Figure 1.1). As the continents moved apart there was an intense period of plate tectonic activity. Seafloor spreading was so vig- orous that the mid-ocean ridge buoyed upwards and displaced so much water that there was a marine transgression. Later in the Mesozoic those seas regressed and then transgressed again. 
Question: during the cenozoic, the continents that had once been part of pangaea
Options:(A) Began to move back together (B) Have remained stationary (C) Have grown permanent ice sheets (D) Continued to move apart
Answer:",D

Answer:",B
628,"Context: Chemical weathering is different than mechanical weathering. The minerals in the rock change. The rock changes composition and becomes a different type of rock. Most minerals form at high pressure or high temperatures deep within Earth. But at Earths surface, temperatures and pressures are much lower. Minerals that were stable deeper in the crust are not stable at the surface. Thats why chemical weathering happens. Minerals that formed at higher temperature and pressure change into minerals that are stable at the surface. Chemical weathering is important. It starts the process of changing solid rock into soil. We need soil to grow food and create other materials we need. Chemical weathering works through chemical reactions that change the rock. There are many agents of chemical weathering. Remember that water was a main agent of mechanical weathering. Well, water is also an agent of chemical weathering. That makes it a double agent! Carbon dioxide and oxygen are also agents of chemical weathering. Each of these is discussed below. 
Question: chemical weathering
Options:(A) May change the composition of a piece of rock (B) but definitely changes the size (C) b Is no different from mechanical weathering in changing rocks (D) c Is much less important than mechanical weathering because it acts under very few conditions (E) d May change the size of a piece of rock (F) but definitely changes the composition
Answer:",D
629,"Context: What do you guess carbonate minerals contain? If you guessed carbon, you would be right! All carbonates contain one carbon atom bonded to three oxygen atoms. Carbonates may include other elements. A few are calcium, iron, and copper. Carbonate minerals are often found where seas once covered the land. Some carbonate minerals are very common. Calcite contains calcium, carbon, and oxygen. Have you ever been in a limestone cave or seen a marble tile? Calcite is in both limestone and marble. Azurite and malachite are also carbonate minerals, but they contain copper instead of calcium. They are not as common as calcite. They are used in jewelry. You can see in Figure 3.8 that they are very colorful. 
Question: the most common minerals in earths crust are the carbonate minerals.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
630,"Context: Remember that the most common minerals in Earths crust are the silicate minerals. Many silicate minerals form in igneous or metamorphic rocks. The minerals that form at the highest temperatures and pressures are the least stable at the surface. Clay is stable at the surface and chemical weathering converts many minerals to clay (Figure 1.1). There are many types of chemical weathering because there are many agents of chemical weathering. Deforestation in Brazil reveals the under- lying clay-rich soil. 
Question: why do silicate minerals turn to clay at the surface?
Options:(A) Unlike silicates (B) clay is stable at surface temperatures and pressures (C) b Silicate minerals are unstable in the acid rain found at the surface (D) c Clay is what all minerals at the surface eventually turn to (E) silicates are just quicker (F) d None of the above
Answer:",A
631,"Context: A water molecule has a very simple chemical formula, H2 O, two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom. But water is pretty remarkable in terms of all the things it can do. Remember that water is a polar molecule. The positive side of the molecule attracts negative ions and the negative side attracts positive ions. So water molecules separate the ions from their compounds and surround them. Water can completely dissolve some minerals, such as salt. Weathered rock in Walnut Canyon near Flagstaff, Arizona. Hydrolysis is the name of the chemical reaction between a chemical compound and water. When this reaction takes place, water dissolves ions from the mineral and carries them away. These elements have been leached. Through hydrolysis, a mineral such as potassium feldspar is leached of potassium and changed into a clay mineral. Clay minerals are more stable at the Earths surface. 
Question: hydrolysis is
Options:(A) Acid rain (B) The process of removing dissolved minerals as they are carried to lower layers in soil (C) Hydrogen or hydroxide ions replace the cations in a mineral to change the mineral (D) Oxygen reacts with another element to create a metal oxide
Answer:",C
632,"Context: Oxides contain one or two metal elements combined with oxygen. Many important metal ores are oxides. Hematite (Fe2 O3 ), with two iron atoms to three oxygen atoms, and magnetite (Fe3 O4 ) (Figure 1.7), with three iron atoms to four oxygen atoms, are both iron oxides. Magnetite is one of the most distinctive oxides since it is magnetic. 
Question: which of these is a metal oxide?
Options:(A) Iron (B) Rust (C) Carbonic acid (D) All of the above
Answer:",B
633,"Context: Acid rain water is more acidic than normal rain water. Acidity is measured on the pH scale. Lower numbers are more acidic and higher numbers are less acidic (also called more alkaline) (Figure 1.3). Natural rain is somewhat acidic, with a pH of 5.6; acid rain must have a pH of less than 5.0. A small change in pH represents a large change in acidity: rain with a pH of 4.6 is 10 times more acidic than normal rain (with a pH of 5.6). Rain with a pH of 3.6 is 100 times more acidic. Regions with a lot of coal-burning power plants have the most acidic rain. The acidity of average rainwater in the northeastern United States has fallen to between 4.0 and 4.6. Acid fog has even lower pH with an average of around 3.4. One fog in Southern California in 1986 had a pH of 1.7, equal to toilet-bowl cleaner. In arid climates, such as in Southern California, acids deposit on the ground dry. Acid precipitation ends up on the land surface and in water bodies. Some forest soils in the northeast are five to ten times more acidic than they were two or three decades ago. Acid droplets move down through acidic soils to lower the pH of streams and lakes even more. Acids strip soil of metals and nutrients, which collect in streams and lakes. As a result, stripped soils may no longer provide the nutrients that native plants need. A pH scale goes from 1 to 14; numbers are shown with the pH of some common substances. A value of 7 is neutral. The strongest acids are at the low end of the scale and the strongest bases are at the high end. 
Question: the acid in normal (non-polluted) rainwater comes from
Options:(A) Carbon dioxide combining with water in the atmosphere (B) Photosynthesis (C) Hydrochloric acid combining with rainwater in the atmosphere (D) Hydrolysis
Answer:",A
634,"Context: Oxidation is a chemical reaction that takes place when oxygen reacts with another element. Oxygen is very strongly chemically reactive. The most familiar type of oxidation is when iron reacts with oxygen to create rust (Figure 1.4). Minerals that are rich in iron break down as the iron oxidizes and forms new compounds. Iron oxide produces the red color in soils. 
Question: oxidation is common because
Options:(A) Oxygen is a polar molecule that attaches to ions in the rock (B) Oxygen is the most common component of the atmosphere (C) Oxygen is highly chemically reactive (D) Both A and B
Answer:",C
635,"Context: Mechanical weathering increases the rate of chemical weathering. As rock breaks into smaller pieces, the surface area of the pieces increases Figure 1.5.

Answer:",D
637,"Context: Now that you know what chemical weathering is, can you think of some other ways chemical weathering might occur? Chemical weathering can also be contributed to by plants and animals. As plant roots take in soluble ions as nutrients, certain elements are exchanged. Plant roots and bacterial decay use carbon dioxide in the process of respiration. 
Question: how can plants cause chemical weathering?

Answer:",B
638,"Context: Clouds have a big influence on weather: by preventing solar radiation from reaching the ground. by absorbing warmth that is re-emitted from the ground. as the source of precipitation. When there are no clouds, there is less insulation. As a result, cloudless days can be extremely hot, and cloudless nights can be very cold. For this reason, cloudy days tend to have a lower range of temperatures than clear days. 
Question: how do clouds have an influence on weather?
Options:(A) Prevents solar radiation from reaching the ground (B) Absorbs warmth emitted from the ground (C) A source of precipitation (D) All of the above
Answer:",D
639,"Context: Clouds are classified in several ways. The most common classification used today divides clouds into four separate cloud groups, which are determined by their altitude (Figure 1.2). The four cloud types and where they are found in the atmosphere. High clouds form from ice crystals where the air is extremely cold and can hold little water vapor. Cirrus, cirrostratus, and cirrocumulus are all names of high clouds. Middle clouds, including altocumulus and altostratus clouds, may be made of water droplets, ice crystals or both, depending on the air temperatures. Thick and broad altostratus clouds are gray or blue-gray. They often cover the entire sky and usually mean a large storm, bearing a lot of precipitation, is coming. Low clouds are nearly all water droplets. Stratus, stratocumulus, and nimbostratus clouds are common low clouds. Nimbostratus clouds are thick and dark. They bring steady rain or snow. Vertical clouds, clouds with the prefix ""cumulo-,"" grow vertically instead of horizontally and have their bases at low altitude and their tops at high or middle altitude. Clouds grow vertically when strong air currents are rising upward. Precipitating clouds are nimbus clouds. 
Question: clouds are classified by
Options:(A) Altitude (B) Height (C) Color (D) Water content
Answer:",A
640,"Context: Clouds form when air in the atmosphere reaches the dew point. Clouds may form anywhere in the troposphere. Clouds that form on the ground are called fog. 
Question: fog forms when
Options:(A) Warm air meets cold ground or water (B) Cold air meets warm ground or water (C) Warm moist air cools below its dew point (D) All of these
Answer:",D
641,"Context: Clouds are classified on the basis of where and how they form. Three main types of clouds are cirrus, stratus, and cumulus. Figure 16.3 shows these and other types of clouds. Cirrus clouds form high in the troposphere. Because it is so cold they are made of ice crystals. They are thin and wispy. Cirrus clouds dont usually produce precipitation, but they may be a sign that wet weather is coming. Stratus clouds occur low in the troposphere. They form in layers that spread horizontally and may cover the entire sky like a thick blanket. Stratus clouds that produce precipitation are called nimbostratus. The prefix nimbo- means rain. Cumulus clouds are white and puffy. Convection currents make them grow upward and they may grow very tall. When they produce rain, they are called cumulonimbus. 
Question: what do you expect cumulonimbus clouds to be like?
Options:(A) A high cloud made of ice crystals (B) A thick and broad cloud that is gray and precipitating (C) A cloud that is growing vertically and that is precipitating; a thundercloud (D) A low cloud that is thick and dark and that is bringing heavy rain or snow
Answer:",C
642,"Context: Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. High humidity increases the chances of clouds and precipitation. 
Question: when the humidity reaches 100%, water will precipitate.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",A
643,"Context: Humidity usually refers to relative humidity. This is the percent of water vapor in the air relative to the total amount the air can hold. How much water vapor can the air hold? That depends on temperature. Warm air can hold more water vapor than cool air. You can see this in Figure 16.1. 
Question: which of the following describes relative humidity?

644,"Context: Clouds form when air reaches its dew point. This can happen in two ways: (1) Air temperature stays the same but humidity increases. This is common in locations that are warm and humid. (2) Humidity remains the same, but temperature decreases. When the air cools enough to reach 100% humidity, water droplets form. Air cools when it comes into contact with a cold surface or when it rises. Rising air creates clouds when it has been warmed at or near the ground level and then is pushed up over a mountain or mountain range or is thrust over a mass of cold, dense air.

Question: clouds form when air reaches its dew point. this happens when
Options:(A) Air temperature stays the same but humidity increases (B) Humidity stays the same but temperature decreases (C) Air temperature increases but humidity decreases (D) A & B
Answer:",D
645,"Context: Youve probably noticed dew on the grass on a summer morning. Why does dew form? Remember that the land heats up and cools down fairly readily. So when night comes, the land cools. Air that was warm and humid in the daytime also cools over night. As the air cools, it can hold less water vapor. Some of the water vapor condenses on the cool surfaces, such as blades of grass. The temperature at which water vapor condenses is called the dew point. If this temperature is below freezing, ice crystals of frost form instead of dew. As you can see in Figure 16.1, the dew point occurs at 100 percent relative humidity. Can you explain why? 
Question: some early mornings, dew drops can be found on grass (or on a car parked outside), but not on other materials like sidewalks. what has happened?
Options:(A) The nighttime temperature on grass and the car went below the dew point (B) but the (C) b The region went below the dew point but the sun in the morning caused some of the dew to evaporate (D) c The relative humidity of the air above the grass and car was higher than it was over the concrete (E) d None of these

646,"Context: Figure 15.3 shows the main gases in air. Nitrogen and oxygen make up 99 percent of air. Argon and carbon dioxide make up much of the rest. These percentages are the same just about everywhere in the atmosphere. Air also includes water vapor. The amount of water vapor varies from place to place. Thats why water vapor isnt included in Figure 15.3. It can make up as much as 4 percent of the air. Ozone is a molecule made of three oxygen atoms. Ozone collects in a layer in the stratosphere. 
Question: what makes up 99% of the atmosphere?
Options:(A) Nitrogen (B) Oxygen (C) Carbon dioxide (D) A & B
Answer:",D
647,"Context: Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. High humidity increases the chances of clouds and precipitation. 
Question: humidity is how much of this is in the air.
Options:(A) Oxygen (B) Nitrogen (C) Water Vapor (D) Both a and b
Answer:",C
648,"Context: Water vapor is not visible unless it condenses to become a cloud. Water vapor condenses around a nucleus, such as dust, smoke, or a salt crystal. This forms a tiny liquid droplet. Billions of these water droplets together make a cloud. 
Question: when water vapor turns into a cloud, it is doing this process.
Options:(A) Evaporation (B) Condensation (C) Precipitation (D) Sublimation
Answer:",B
649,"Context: Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air in a particular spot. We usually use the term to mean relative humidity, the percentage of water vapor a certain volume of air is holding relative to the maximum amount it can contain. If the humidity today is 80%, it means that the air contains 80% of the total amount of water it can hold at that temperature. What will happen if the humidity increases to more than 100%? The excess water condenses and forms precipitation. Since warm air can hold more water vapor than cool air, raising or lowering temperature can change airs relative humidity (Figure 1.1). The temperature at which air becomes saturated with water is called the airs dew point. This term makes sense, because water condenses from the air as dew if the air cools down overnight and reaches 100% humidity. This diagram shows the amount of water air can hold at different temperatures. The temperatures are given in degrees Cel- sius. 
Question: when the weather report says there is 90% humidity, it means that 90% of the gas molecules are water vapor.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
650,"Context: Particulates reduce visibility. In the western United States, people can now ordinarily see only about 100 to 150 kilometers (60 to 90 miles), which is one-half to two-thirds the natural (pre-pollution) range on a clear day. In the East, people can only see about 40 to 60 kilometers (25-35 miles), about one-fifth the distance they could see without any air pollution (Figure 1.1). Particulates reduce the amount of sunshine that reaches the ground, which may reduce photosynthesis. Since particulates form the nucleus for raindrops, snowflakes, or other forms of precipitation, precipitation may increase Smog in New York City. when particulates are high. An increase in particles in the air seems to increase the number of raindrops, but often decreases their size. By reducing sunshine, particulates can also alter air temperature as mentioned above. Imagine how much all of the sources of particulates combine to reduce temperatures. What affect might this have on global warming? 
Question: what do particulates in the atmosphere do?
Options:(A) They trap heat (B) They shield Earth’s surface from harmful solar radiation (C) They nucleate water vapor to form clouds (D) They help plants to grow better
Answer:",C
651,"Context: When a warm air mass runs into a cold air mass it creates a warm front. This is shown in Figure 16.8. The warm air mass is moving faster than the cold air mass, so it flows up over the cold air mass. As the warm air rises, it cools, resulting in clouds and sometimes light precipitation. Warm fronts move slowly and cover a wide area. After a warm front passes, the warm air mass behind it brings warmer temperatures. The warm air is also likely to be more humid. 
Question: warmer air can hold more moisture than colder air.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",A
652,"Context: Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. High humidity increases the chances of clouds and precipitation.

653,"Context: Nitrogen and oxygen together make up 99% of the planets atmosphere. Nitrogen makes up the bulk of the atmosphere, but is not involved in geological or biological processes in its gaseous form. Nitrogen fixing is described in the chapter Life on Earth. Oxygen is extremely important because it is needed by animals for respiration. The rest of the gases are minor components but sometimes are very important (Figure 1.1). Nitrogen and oxygen make up 99% of the atmosphere; carbon dioxide is a very important minor component. 
Question: atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen are extremely important for life on earth.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
654,"Context: When sunlight heats Earths surface, some of the heat radiates back into the atmosphere. Some of this heat is absorbed by gases in the atmosphere. This is the greenhouse effect, and it helps to keep Earth warm. The greenhouse effect allows Earth to have temperatures that can support life. Gases that absorb heat in the atmosphere are called greenhouse gases. They include carbon dioxide and water vapor. Human actions have increased the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This is shown in Figure 15.11. The added gases have caused a greater greenhouse effect. How do you think this affects Earths temperature? 
Question: what do greenhouse gases in the atmosphere do?
Options:(A) They trap heat (B) They shield Earth’s surface from harmful solar radiation (C) They nucleate water vapor to form clouds (D) They help plants to grow better
Answer:",A
655,"Context: Several properties of the atmosphere change with altitude, but the composition of the natural gases does not. The proportions of gases in the atmosphere are everywhere the same, with one exception. At about 20 km to 40 km above the surface, there is a greater concentration of ozone molecules than in other portions of the atmosphere. This is called the ozone layer. 
Question: the proportion of gases is the same throughout the atmosphere.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
656,"Context: When light passes from one medium (or type of matter) to another, it changes speed. You can actually see this happen. If light strikes a new substance at an angle, the light appears to bend. This is what explains the straw looking broken in the picture above. So, does light always bend as it travels into a new medium? If light travels straight into a new substance it is not bent. You may know this angle as perpendicular. The light still slows down, just does not appear to bend. Any angle other than perpendicular the light will bend as it slows down. The bending of light is called refraction. Figure 1.1 shows how refraction occurs. Notice that the angle of light changes again as it passes from the glass back to the air. In this case, the speed increases, and the ray of light resumes its initial direction. For a more detailed explanation of refraction, watch this video: Click image to the left or use the URL below.

Question: when light from a very distant bright source is bent there is
Options:(A) A super-massive object (B) Dark matter (C) Gravitational lensing (D) All of the above
Answer:",D
657,"Context: The things we observe in space are objects that emit some type of electromagnetic radiation. However, scientists think that matter that emits light makes up only a small part of the matter in the universe. The rest of the matter, about 80%, is dark matter. Dark matter emits no electromagnetic radiation, so we cant observe it directly. However, astronomers know that dark matter exists because its gravity affects the motion of objects around it. When astronomers measure how spiral galaxies rotate, they find that the outside edges of a galaxy rotate at the same speed as parts closer to the center. This can only be explained if there is a lot more matter in the galaxy than they can see. Gravitational lensing occurs when light is bent from a very distant bright source around a super-massive object (Figure 1.1). To explain strong gravitational lensing, more matter than is observed must be present. With so little to go on, astronomers dont really know much about the nature of dark matter. One possibility is that it could just be ordinary matter that does not emit radiation in objects such as black holes, neutron stars, and brown dwarfs  objects larger than Jupiter but smaller than the smallest stars. But astronomers cannot find enough of these types of objects, which they have named MACHOs (massive astrophyiscal compact halo object), to account for all the dark matter, so they are thought to be only a small part of the total. Another possibility is that the dark matter is very different from the ordinary matter we see. Some appear to be particles that have gravity, but dont otherwise appear to interact with other particles. Scientists call these theoretical particles WIMPs, which stands for Weakly Interactive Massive Particles. Most scientists who study dark matter think that the dark matter in the universe is a combination of MACHOs and some type of exotic matter, such as WIMPs. Researching dark matter is an active area of scientific research, and astronomers knowledge about dark matter is changing rapidly. 
Question: scientists hypothesize the existence of dark matter because

Answer:",A
658,"Context: About 13.7 billion years ago, the entire universe was packed together. Everything was squeezed into a tiny volume. Then there was an enormous explosion. After this big bang, the universe expanded rapidly (Figure 26.16). All of the matter and energy in the universe has been expanding ever since. Scientists have evidence this is how the universe formed. One piece of evidence is that we see galaxies moving away from us. If they are moving apart, they must once have been together. Also, there is energy left over from this explosion throughout the universe. The theory for the origin of the universe is called the Big Bang Theory.

There might just be a lot of black holes. Another possibility is that the universe contains a lot of matter that is different from anything we know. If it doesnt interact much with ordinary matter, it would be very difficult or impossible to detect directly. Most scientists who study dark matter think it is a combination. Ordinary matter is part of it. That is mixed with some kind of matter that we havent discovered yet. Most scientists think that ordinary matter is less than half of the total matter in the universe.

Question: what does dark energy do?
Options:(A) It causes the expansion of the universe to slow down (B) It causes the universe to expand at an increasing rate (C) It causes the universe to heat up (D) It causes stars and galaxies to form
Answer:",B
662,"Context: Astronomers who study the expansion of the universe are interested in knowing the rate of that expansion. Is the rate fast enough to overcome the attractive pull of gravity? If yes, then the universe will expand forever, although the expansion will slow down over time. If no, then the universe would someday start to contract, and eventually get squeezed together in a big crunch, the opposite of the Big Bang. Recently, astronomers have made a discovery that answers that question: the rate at which the universe is expanding is actually increasing. In other words, the universe is expanding faster now than ever before, and in the future it will expand even faster. So now astronomers think that the universe will keep expanding forever. But it also proposes a perplexing new question: what is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate? One possible hypothesis involves a new, hypothetical form of energy called dark energy (Figure 1.2). Some scientists think that dark energy makes up as much as 71% of the total energy content of the universe. Today matter makes up a small percentage of the universe, but at the start of the universe it made up much more. Where did dark energy, if it even exists, come from? Other scientists have other hypotheses about why the universe is continuing to expand; the causes of the universes expansion is another unanswered question that scientists are researching.

666,"Context: A divergent plate boundary can also occur within a continent. This is called continental rifting (Figure 6.18). Magma rises beneath the continent. The crust thins, breaks, and then splits apart. This first produces a rift valley. The East African Rift is a rift valley. Eastern Africa is splitting away from the African continent. Eventually, as the continental crust breaks apart, oceanic crust will form. This is how the Atlantic Ocean formed when Pangaea broke up.

673,"Context: Remember that Wegener used the similarity of the mountains on the west and east sides of the Atlantic as evidence for his continental drift hypothesis. Those mountains rose at the convergent plate boundaries where the continents were smashing together to create Pangaea. As Pangaea came together about 300 million years ago, the continents were separated by an ocean where the Atlantic is now. The proto-Atlantic ocean shrank as the Pacific Ocean grew. The Appalachian mountains of eastern North America formed at a convergent plate boundary as Pangaea came together (Figure 1.1). About 200 million years ago, the they were probably as high as the Himalayas, but they have been weathered and eroded significantly since the breakup of Pangaea. Pangaea has been breaking apart since about 250 million years ago. Divergent plate boundaries formed within the continents to cause them to rift apart. The continents are still moving apart, since the Pacific is shrinking as the Atlantic is growing. If the continents continue in their current directions, they will come together to create a supercontinent on the other side of the planet in around 200 million years. If you go back before Pangaea there were earlier supercontinents, such as Rodinia, which existed 750 million to 1.1 billion years ago, and Columbia, at 1.5 to 1.8 billion years ago. This supercontinent cycle is responsible for most of the geologic features that we see and many more that are long gone (Figure 1.2). Scientists think that the creation and breakup of a supercontinent takes place about every 500 million years. The supercontinent before Pangaea was Rodinia.

676,"Context: The scientists used geologic dating techniques on seafloor rocks. They found that the youngest rocks on the seafloor were at the mid-ocean ridges. The rocks get older with distance from the ridge crest. The scientists were surprised to find that the oldest seafloor is less than 180 million years old. This may seem old, but the oldest continental crust is around 4 billion years old. Scientists also discovered that the mid-ocean ridge crest is nearly sediment free. The crust is also very thin there. With distance from the ridge crest, the sediments and crust get thicker. This also supports the idea that the youngest rocks are on the ridge axis and that the rocks get older with distance away from the ridge (Figure 6.12). Something causes the seafloor to be created at the ridge crest. The seafloor is also destroyed in a relatively short time. 
Question: the seafloor is youngest in or near the rift valley.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",A
677,"Context: Plates move apart at mid-ocean ridges. Lava rises upward, erupts, and cools. Later, more lava erupts and pushes the original seafloor outward. This is seafloor spreading. Seafloor spreading forms new oceanic crust. The rising magma causes earthquakes. Most mid-ocean ridges are located deep below the sea. The island of Iceland sits right on the Mid-Atlantic ridge (Figure 6.17). 
Question: what happens at a mid-ocean ridge?
Options:(A) Two plates slide past each other (B) Two plates push into each other (C) Two plates move apart (D) Two plates collide
Answer:",C
678,"Context: Scientists were surprised to find huge mountains and deep trenches when they mapped the seafloor. The mid-ocean ridges form majestic mountain ranges through the deep oceans (Figure 6.10). Deep sea trenches are found near chains of active volcanoes. These volcanoes can be at the edges of continents or in the oceans. Trenches are the deepest places on Earth. The deepest trench is the Mariana Trench in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. This trench plunges about 11 kilometers (35,840 feet) beneath sea level. The ocean floor does have lots of flat areas. These abyssal plains are like the scientists had predicted. 
Question: the mid-ocean ridge can only be found below sea level.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
679,"Context: Remember that the mid-ocean ridge is where hot mantle material upwells in a convection cell. The upwelling mantle melts due to pressure release to form lava. Lava flows at the surface cool rapidly to become basalt, but deeper in the crust, magma cools more slowly to form gabbro. The entire ridge system is made up of igneous rock that is either extrusive or intrusive. The seafloor is also igneous rock with some sediment that has fallen onto it. Earthquakes are common at mid-ocean ridges since the movement of magma and oceanic crust results in crustal shaking. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:

680,"Context: Scientists were also surprised to discover a pattern of stripes of normal and reversed polarity. These stripes surround the mid-ocean ridges. There is one long stripe with normal magnetism at the top of the ridge. Next to that stripe are two long stripes with reversed magnetism. One is on either side of the normal stripe. Next come two normal stripes and then two reversed stripes, and so on across the ocean floor. The magnetic stripes end abruptly at the edges of continents. Sometimes the stripes end at a deep sea trench (Figure 6.11).

682,"Context: Sedimentary rocks are formed in horizontal layers. This is magnificently displayed around the southwestern United States. The arid climate allows rock layers to be well exposed (Figure 7.4). The lowest layers are the oldest and the higher layers are younger. Folds, joints and faults are caused by stresses. Figure 7.5 shows joints in a granite hillside. If a sedimentary rock is tilted or folded, we know that stresses have changed the rock (Figure 7.6). 
Question: all of the rocks at divergent plate boundaries are sedimentary.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
683,"Context: Iceland provides us with a fabulous view of a mid-ocean ridge above sea level (Figure 1.1) As you can see, where plates diverge at a mid-ocean ridge is a rift valley that marks the boundary between the two plates. Basalt lava erupts into that rift valley and forms new seafloor. Seafloor on one side of the rift is part of one plate and seafloor on the other side is part of another plate. Leif the Lucky Bridge straddles the divergent plate boundary. Look back at the photo at the top. You may think that the rock on the left side of the valley looks pretty much like the rock on the right side. Thats true - its all basalt and it even all has the same magnetic polarity. The rocks on both sides are extremely young. Whats different is that the rock one side of the bridge is the youngest rock of the North American Plate while the rock on the other side is the youngest rock on the Eurasian plate. This is a block diagram of a divergent plate boundary. Remember that most of these are on the seafloor and only in Iceland do we get such a good view of a divergent plate boundary in the ocean.

684,"Context: The roadway across the Golden Gate Bridge rises and falls as much as 16 feet depending on the temperature. When the sun hits the bridge, the metal expands and the bridge cables stretch. As the fog rolls in, the cables contract and the bridge goes up. Curators from the Outdoor Exploratorium in San Francisco have set up a scope two miles away so you can see how the bridge is moving up or down depending on the weather. For more information on how the bridge moves due to temperature, see http://science.kqed.org/quest/video/quest-lab-bridge-thermometer/ . Heat is the transfer of thermal energy between objects that have different temperatures. Thermal energy always moves from an object with a higher temperature to an object with a lower temperature. Specific heat is the amount of energy (in joules) needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of a substance by 1C. Substances differ in their specific heat. 
Question: assuming the leif the lucky bridge is infinitely strong, over a very long period of time, what will happen to it?

686,"Context: The amount of damage depends on the amount of development in the region. The 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake, near Anchorage, was the largest earthquake ever recorded in North America. The gigantic quake had a magnitude of 9.2. The earthquake lasted for several minutes and the ground slipped up to 11.5 meters (38 feet). An area of 100,000 square miles (250,000 square km) was affected. The ground liquefied, causing landslides (Figure 7.40). The earthquake occurred at a subduction zone, and large tsunami up to 70 meters (20 feet) high were created. Despite the intensity of the earthquake, only 131 people died. Most deaths were due to the tsunami. Property damage was just over $300 million ($1.8 billion in 2007 U.S. dollars). The reason there was such a small amount of damage is that very few people lived in the area (Alaska had only been a state for five years!). A similar earthquake today would affect many more people. 
Question: when an earthquake happens, we say that its __________ was located 100 miles northwest of san francisco.
Options:(A) Breaking point (B) Focus (C) Epicenter (D) Focal point
Answer:",C
687,"Context: The description of how earthquakes occur is called elastic rebound theory (Figure 1.1). Elastic rebound theory. Stresses build on both sides of a fault, causing the rocks to deform plastically (Time 2). When the stresses become too great, the rocks break and end up in a different location (Time 3). This releases the built up energy and creates an earthquake. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: 
Question: the theory that stress builds up in rocks until they can no longer bend so they break, causing an earthquake is
Options:(A) Continental Drift Theory (B) Plate Tectonics Theory (C) Elastic Rebound Theory (D) Earthquake Action Theory
Answer:",C
688,"Context: Stress is the force applied to an object. In geology, stress is the force per unit area that is placed on a rock. Four types of stresses act on materials. A deeply buried rock is pushed down by the weight of all the material above it. Since the rock cannot move, it cannot deform. This is called confining stress. Compression squeezes rocks together, causing rocks to fold or fracture (break) (Figure 1.1). Compression is the most common stress at convergent plate boundaries. Stress caused these rocks to fracture. Rocks that are pulled apart are under tension. Rocks under tension lengthen or break apart. Tension is the major type of stress at divergent plate boundaries. When forces are parallel but moving in opposite directions, the stress is called shear (Figure 1.2). Shear stress is the most common stress at transform plate boundaries. Shearing in rocks. The white quartz vein has been elongated by shear. When stress causes a material to change shape, it has undergone strain or deformation. Deformed rocks are common in geologically active areas. A rocks response to stress depends on the rock type, the surrounding temperature, the pressure conditions the rock is under, the length of time the rock is under stress, and the type of stress. 
Question: shearing is the stress that causes an earthquake.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
689,"Context: Geologists study earthquake waves to see Earths interior. Waves of energy radiate out from an earthquakes focus. These are called seismic waves (Figure 6.1). Seismic waves change speed as they move through different materials. This causes them to bend. Some seismic waves do not travel through liquids or gases. Scientists use all of this information to understand what makes up the Earths interior. 
Question: scientists call the energy from earthquakes
Options:(A) Electromagnetic waves (B) Earthquake waves (C) Radiant waves (D) Seismic waves

Answer:",A
691,"Context: The point where the rock ruptures is the earthquakes focus. The focus is below the Earths surface. A shallow earthquake has a focus less than 70 kilometers (45 miles). An intermediate-focus earthquake has a focus between 70 and 300 kilometers (45 to 200 miles). A deep-focus earthquake is greater than 300 kilometers (200 miles). About 75% of earthquakes have a focus in the top 10 to 15 kilometers (6 to 9 miles) of the crust. Shallow earthquakes cause the most damage. This is because the focus is near the Earths surface, where people live. 
Question: deep focus earthquakes cause the most damage.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
692,"Context: An earthquake is sudden ground movement caused by the sudden release of energy stored in rocks. Earthquakes happen when so much stress builds up in the rocks that the rocks rupture. The energy is transmitted by seismic waves. Earthquakes can be so small they go completely unnoticed, or so large that it can take years for a region to recover. 
Question: an earthquake can be so small it can go unnoticed.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",A
693,"Context: Nearly 95% of all earthquakes take place along one of the three types of plate boundaries. About 80% of all earthquakes strike around the Pacific Ocean basin because it is lined with convergent and transform boundaries (Figure 1.2). About 15% take place in the Mediterranean-Asiatic Belt, where convergence is causing the Indian Plate to run into the Eurasian Plate. The remaining 5% are scattered around other plate boundaries or are intraplate earthquakes. Earthquake epicenters for magnitude 8.0 and greater events since 1900. The earthquake depth shows that most large quakes are shallow focus, but some sub- ducted plates cause deep focus quakes.

Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",A
697,"Context: Earthquake magnitude affects how much damage is done in an earthquake. A larger earthquake damages more buildings and kills more people than a smaller earthquake. But thats not the only factor that determines earthquake damage. The location of an earthquake relative to a large city is important. More damage is done if the ground shakes for a long time. The amount of damage also depends on the geology of the region. Strong, solid bedrock shakes less than soft or wet soils. Wet soils liquefy during an earthquake and become like quicksand. Soil on a hillside that is shaken loose can become a landslide. Hazard maps help city planners choose the best locations for buildings (Figure 7.38). For example, when faced with two possible locations for a new hospital, planners must build on bedrock rather than silt and clay.

700,"Context: The 1985 Mexico City earthquake measured magnitude 8.1. The earthquake killed at least 9,000 people, injured 30,000 more, and left 100,000 people homeless. It destroyed 416 buildings, and seriously damaged 3,000 other buildings. The intense destruction was due to the soft ground the city is built on. Silt and clay fill a basin made of solid rock. In an earthquake, seismic waves bounce back-and-forth off the sides and bottom of the rock basin. This amplifies the shaking. The wet clay converts to quicksand (Figure 7.39). Many buildings were not anchored to bedrock. They settled into the muck. This caused enormous damage. Water, sewer, and electrical systems were destroyed, resulting in fires. Acapulco was much closer to the epicenter, but since the city is built on bedrock it suffered little damage.

Answer:",D
725,"Context: Earthquakes in Japan are caused by ocean-ocean convergence. The Philippine Plate and the Pacific Plate subduct beneath oceanic crust on the North American or Eurasian plates. This complex plate tectonics situation creates a chain of volcanoes, the Japanese islands, and as many as 1,500 earthquakes annually. In March 2011 an enormous 9.0 earthquake struck off of Sendai in northeastern Japan. This quake, called the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, was the most powerful ever to strike Japan and one of the top five known in the world. Damage from the earthquake was nearly overshadowed by the tsunami it generated, which wiped out coastal cities and towns This cross section of earthquake epicen- ters with depth outlines the subducting plate with shallow, intermediate, and deep earthquakes. (Figure 1.2). Several months after the earthquake, about 22,000 people were dead or missing, and 190,000 buildings had been damaged or destroyed. Aftershocks, some as large as major earthquakes, have continued to rock the region. Destruction in Ofunato, Japan, from the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake.

726,"Context: Added water creates natural hazards produced by gravity (Figure 1.2). On hillsides with soils rich in clay, little rain, and not much vegetation to hold the soil in place, a time of high precipitation will create a mudflow. Mudflows follow river channels, washing out bridges, trees, and homes that are in their path. A lahar is mudflow that flows down a composite volcano (Figure 1.3). Ash mixes with snow and ice melted by the eruption to produce hot, fast-moving flows. The lahar caused by the eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in Columbia in 1985 killed more than 23,000 people.

727,"Context: The Japanese received a one-two punch in March 2011. The 2011 Tohoku earthquake offshore was a magnitude 9.0 and damage from the quake was extensive. People didnt have time to recover before massive tsunami waves hit the island nation. As seen in Figure 1.2, waves in some regions topped 9 meters (27 feet). The tsunami did much more damage than the massive earthquake (Figure 1.3). Worst was the damage done to nuclear power plants along the northeastern coast. Eleven reactors were automatically shut down. Power and backup power were lost at the Fukushima plant, leading to equipment failures, meltdowns, and the release of radioactive materials. Control and cleanup of the disabled plants will go on for many years.

728,"Context: The point where the rock ruptures is the earthquakes focus. The focus is below the Earths surface. A shallow earthquake has a focus less than 70 kilometers (45 miles). An intermediate-focus earthquake has a focus between 70 and 300 kilometers (45 to 200 miles). A deep-focus earthquake is greater than 300 kilometers (200 miles). About 75% of earthquakes have a focus in the top 10 to 15 kilometers (6 to 9 miles) of the crust. Shallow earthquakes cause the most damage. This is because the focus is near the Earths surface, where people live. 
Question: in a subduction zone, the most dangerous earthquakes are those at __________ depths.
Options:(A) Shallow (B) Intermediate (C) Deep (D) Any
Answer:",A
729,"Context: The Pacific Northwest of the United States is at risk from a potentially massive earthquake that could strike any time. The subduction of three small plates beneath North America produces active volcanoes, the Cascades. As with an active subduction zone, there are also earthquakes. Surprisingly, large earthquakes only hit every 300 to 600 years. The last was in 1700, with an estimated magnitude of around 9. A quake of that magnitude today could produce an incredible amount of destruction and untold fatalities.

Question: earthquakes at convergent plate boundaries are largest
Options:(A) Where an oceanic and continental plate converge (B) Where two continental plates converge (C) Where two oceanic plates converge (D) At any of these types of convergent plate boundaries
Answer:",D
732,"Context: Earthquakes also occur at divergent plate boundaries. At mid-ocean ridges, these earthquakes tend to be small and shallow focus because the plates are thin, young, and hot. Earthquakes in the oceans are usually far from land, so they have little effect on peoples lives. On land, where continents are rifting apart, earthquakes are larger and stronger. 
Question: transform faults create larger earthquakes than convergent plate boundaries.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
733,"Context: Stress is the force applied to an object. In geology, stress is the force per unit area that is placed on a rock. Four types of stresses act on materials. A deeply buried rock is pushed down by the weight of all the material above it. Since the rock cannot move, it cannot deform. This is called confining stress. Compression squeezes rocks together, causing rocks to fold or fracture (break) (Figure 1.1). Compression is the most common stress at convergent plate boundaries. Stress caused these rocks to fracture. Rocks that are pulled apart are under tension. Rocks under tension lengthen or break apart. Tension is the major type of stress at divergent plate boundaries. When forces are parallel but moving in opposite directions, the stress is called shear (Figure 1.2). Shear stress is the most common stress at transform plate boundaries. Shearing in rocks. The white quartz vein has been elongated by shear. When stress causes a material to change shape, it has undergone strain or deformation. Deformed rocks are common in geologically active areas. A rocks response to stress depends on the rock type, the surrounding temperature, the pressure conditions the rock is under, the length of time the rock is under stress, and the type of stress. 
Question: this is the type of stress at a transform boundary, which causes an earthquake.
Options:(A) Convergent (B) Divergent (C) Shearing (D) None of the above
Answer:",C
734,"Context: Were on a new trip now. We will start in Mexico, in the region surrounding the Gulf of California, where a divergent plate boundary is rifting Baja California and mainland Mexico apart. Then we will move up into California, where plates on both sides of a transform boundary are sliding past each other. Finally well end up off of the Pacific Northwest, where a divergent plate boundary is very near a subduction zone just offshore. In the Figure 1.1 a red bar where seafloor spreading is taking place. A long black line is a transform fault and a black line with hatch marks is a trench where subduction is taking place. Notice how one type of plate boundary transitions into another. 
Question: the boundary between the pacific and north american plates is the
Options:(A) Junction fault (B) San Andreas Fault (C) California Fault (D) Hayward Fault
Answer:",B
735,"Context: As you learned in the chapter Plate Tectonics, the boundary between the Pacific and North American plates runs through much of California as the San Andreas Fault zone. As you can see in the (Figure 1.1), there is more than just one fault running through the area. There is really a fault zone. The San Andreas Fault runs from south to north up the peninsula, through San Francisco, gets through part of Marin north of the bay, and then goes out to sea. The other faults are part of the fault zone, and they too can be deadly. The faults along the San Andreas Fault zone produce around 10,000 earthquakes a year. Most are tiny, but occasion- ally one is massive. In the San Francisco Bay Area, the Hayward Fault was the site of a magnitude 7.0 earthquake in 1868. The 1906 quake on the San Andreas Fault had a magnitude estimated at about 7.9 (Figure 1.1). About 3,000 people died and 28,000 buildings were lost, mostly in the fire that followed the earthquake. (a) The San Andreas Fault zone in the San Francisco Bay Area. (b) The 1906 San Francisco earthquake is still the most costly natural disaster in California history. Recent California earthquakes occurred in: 1989: Loma Prieta earthquake near Santa Cruz, California. Magnitude 7.1 quake, 63 deaths, 3,756 injuries, 12,000+ people homeless, property damage about $6 billion. 1994: Northridge earthquake on a blind thrust fault near Los Angeles.

742,"Context: The 1985 Mexico City earthquake measured magnitude 8.1. The earthquake killed at least 9,000 people, injured 30,000 more, and left 100,000 people homeless. It destroyed 416 buildings, and seriously damaged 3,000 other buildings. The intense destruction was due to the soft ground the city is built on. Silt and clay fill a basin made of solid rock. In an earthquake, seismic waves bounce back-and-forth off the sides and bottom of the rock basin. This amplifies the shaking. The wet clay converts to quicksand (Figure 7.39). Many buildings were not anchored to bedrock. They settled into the muck. This caused enormous damage. Water, sewer, and electrical systems were destroyed, resulting in fires. Acapulco was much closer to the epicenter, but since the city is built on bedrock it suffered little damage.

749,"Context: Earths crust consists of many tectonic plates that move over time. Due to plate tectonics, the continents changed their shapes and positions during Earth history. As the continents changed, so did the oceans. About 250 million years ago, there was one huge land mass known as Pangaea. There was also one huge ocean called Panthalassa. You can see it in Figure 14.2. By 180 million years ago, Pangaea began to break up. The continents started to drift apart. They slowly moved to where they are today. The movement of the continents caused Panthalassa to break into smaller oceans. These oceans are now known as the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic Oceans. The waters of all the oceans are connected.

The lithosphere is the outermost mechanical layer, which behaves as a brittle, rigid solid. The lithosphere is about 100 kilometers thick. How are crust and lithosphere different from each other? The definition of the lithosphere is based on how Earth materials behave, so it includes the crust and the uppermost mantle, which are both brittle. Since it is rigid and brittle, when stresses act on the lithosphere, it breaks. This is what we experience as an earthquake. Although we sometimes refer to Earths plates as being plates of crust, the plates are actually made of lithosphere. Much more about Earths plates follows in the chapter ""Plate Tectonics.""

765,"Context: Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy between particles of matter that are touching. When energetic particles collide with nearby particles, they transfer some of their thermal energy. From particle to particle, like dominoes falling, thermal energy moves throughout a substance. In Figure 18.5, conduction occurs between particles of the metal in the pot and between particles of the pot and the water. Figure 18.6 shows additional examples of conduction. For a deeper understanding of this method of heat transfer, watch the animation ""Conduction"" at this URL: http://w 
Question: heat that is transferred through rapid collision of atoms is conduction.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",A
766,"Context: A refrigerator is an example of a cooling system. Another example is an air conditioner. The purpose of any cooling system is to transfer thermal energy in order to keep things cool. A refrigerator, for example, transfers thermal energy from the cool air inside the refrigerator to the warm air in the kitchen. If youve ever noticed how warm the back of a running refrigerator gets, then you know that it releases a lot of thermal energy into the room. Q: Thermal energy always moves from a warmer area to a cooler area. How can thermal energy move from the cooler air inside a refrigerator to the warmer air in a room? A: The answer is work. 
Question: in heat transfer, heat flows from a cooler place to a warmer place.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
767,"Context: Scientists know that the mantle is extremely hot because of the heat flowing outward from it and because of its physical properties. Heat flows in two different ways within the Earth: 1. Conduction: Heat is transferred through rapid collisions of atoms, which can only happen if the material is solid. Heat flows from warmer to cooler places until all are the same temperature. The mantle is hot mostly because of heat conducted from the core. Peridotite is formed of crystals of olivine (green) and pyroxene (black). 2. Convection: If a material is able to move, even if it moves very slowly, convection currents can form. Convection in the mantle is the same as convection in a pot of water on a stove. Convection currents within Earths mantle form as material near the core heats up. As the core heats the bottom layer of mantle material, particles move more rapidly, decreasing its density and causing it to rise. The rising material begins the convection current. When the warm material reaches the surface, it spreads horizontally. The material cools because it is no longer near the core. It eventually becomes cool and dense enough to sink back down into the mantle. At the bottom of the mantle, the material travels horizontally and is heated by the core. It reaches the location where warm mantle material rises, and the mantle convection cell is complete (Figure 1.2). Convection. 
Question: scientists know that the mantle is extremely hot because heat flows out of it.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",A
768,"Context: Convection within the Earths mantle causes the plates to move. Mantle material is heated above the core. The hot mantle rises up towards the surface (Figure 6.16). As the mantle rises it cools. At the surface the material moves horizontally away from a mid-ocean ridge crest. The material continues to cool. It sinks back down into the mantle at a deep sea trench. The material sinks back down to the core. It moves horizontally again, completing a convection cell. 
Question: put in order of how convection currents in the mantle move. i. the material that moved up cools and sinks back down into the mantle. ii. the bottom layer of the mantle material rises and spreads horizontally. iii. the mantle material near the core is heated. iv. the bottom layer of the mantle becomes less dense.
Options:(A) IV (B) III (C) II (D) I (E) b III (F) IV (G) II (H) I (I) c I (J) II (K) III (L) IV (M) d III (N) I (O) IV (P) II
Answer:",B
769,"Context: Beneath the crust is the mantle. The mantle is made of hot, solid rock. Through the process of conduction, heat flows from warmer objects to cooler objects (Figure 6.4). The lower mantle is heated directly by conduction from the core. Hot lower mantle material rises upwards (Figure 6.5). As it rises, it cools. At the top of the mantle it moves horizontally. Over time it becomes cool and dense enough that it sinks. Back at the bottom of the mantle, it travels horizontally. Eventually the material gets to the location where warm mantle material is rising. The rising and sinking of warm and cooler material is convection. The motion described creates a convection cell. 
Question: this layer heats up the mantle.
Options:(A) Crust (B) Lithosphere (C) Asthenosphere (D) Core
Answer:",D
770,"Context: The temperature of the troposphere is highest near the surface of the Earth and decreases with altitude. On average, the temperature gradient of the troposphere is 6.5o C per 1,000 m (3.6o F per 1,000 ft) of altitude. Earths surface is the source of heat for the troposphere. Rock, soil, and water on Earth absorb the Suns light and radiate it back into the atmosphere as heat, so there is more heat near the surface. The temperature is also higher near the surface because gravity pulls in more gases. The greater density of gases causes the temperature to rise. Notice that in the troposphere warmer air is beneath cooler air. This condition is unstable since warm air is less dense than cool air. The warm air near the surface rises and cool air higher in the troposphere sinks, so air in the troposphere does a lot of mixing. This mixing causes the temperature gradient to vary with time and place. The rising and sinking of air in the troposphere means that all of the planets weather takes place in the troposphere. 
Question: the temperature of material near the surface __________ because __________.
Options:(A) Cools; it is no longer being heated from below (B) Cools; it comes into contact with rain (C) snow and ice (D) c Warms; solar radiation (E) d Warms; volcanic activity heats it up
Answer:",A
771,"Context: There are as many types of volcanic eruptions as there are eruptions. Actually more since an eruption can change character as it progresses. Each volcanic eruption is unique, differing in size, style, and composition of erupted material. One key to what makes the eruption unique is the chemical composition of the magma that feeds a volcano, which determines (1) the eruption style, (2) the type of volcanic cone that forms, and (3) the composition of rocks that are found at the volcano. Different minerals within a rock melt at different temperatures. The amount of partial melting and the composition of the original rock determine the composition of the magma. The words that describe composition of igneous rocks also describe magma composition. Mafic magmas are low in silica and contain more dark, magnesium- and iron-rich mafic minerals, such as olivine and pyroxene. Felsic magmas are higher in silica and contain lighter colored minerals such as quartz and orthoclase feldspar. The higher the amount of silica in the magma, the higher is its viscosity. Viscosity is a liquids resistance to flow. Viscosity determines what the magma will do. Mafic magma is not viscous and will flow easily to the surface. Felsic magma is viscous and does not flow easily. Most felsic magma will stay deeper in the crust and will cool to form igneous intrusive rocks such as granite and granodiorite. If felsic magma rises into a magma chamber, it may be too viscous to move, so it gets stuck. Dissolved gases become trapped by thick magma. The magma churns in the chamber and the pressure builds. Magma collects in magma chambers in the crust at 160 kilometers (100 miles) beneath the surface. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:

Answer:",B
774,"Context: Convection within the Earths mantle causes the plates to move. Mantle material is heated above the core. The hot mantle rises up towards the surface (Figure 6.16). As the mantle rises it cools. At the surface the material moves horizontally away from a mid-ocean ridge crest. The material continues to cool. It sinks back down into the mantle at a deep sea trench. The material sinks back down to the core. It moves horizontally again, completing a convection cell.

Answer:",A
775,"Context: At the end of the Paleozoic there was one continent and one ocean. When Pangaea began to break apart about 180 million years ago, the Panthalassa Ocean separated into the individual but interconnected oceans that we see today on Earth. The Atlantic Ocean basin formed as Pangaea split apart. The seafloor spreading that pushed Africa and South America apart is continuing to enlarge the Atlantic Ocean (Figure 1.1). As the continents moved apart there was an intense period of plate tectonic activity. Seafloor spreading was so vig- orous that the mid-ocean ridge buoyed upwards and displaced so much water that there was a marine transgression. Later in the Mesozoic those seas regressed and then transgressed again. 
Question: when two continents split apart, this forms.
Options:(A) a mountain range (B) a transform fault (C) a volcanic arc (D) a mid-ocean ridge
Answer:",D
776,"Context: If seafloor spreading drives the plates, what drives seafloor spreading? This goes back to Arthur Holmes idea of mantle convection. Picture two convection cells side by side in the mantle, similar to the illustration in Figure 1.2. 1. Hot mantle from the two adjacent cells rises at the ridge axis, creating new ocean crust. 2. The top limb of the convection cell moves horizontally away from the ridge crest, as does the new seafloor. 3. The outer limbs of the convection cells plunge down into the deeper mantle, dragging oceanic crust as well. This takes place at the deep sea trenches. 4. The material sinks to the core and moves horizontally. 5. The material heats up and reaches the zone where it rises again. 
Question: how does the sinking side of a convection cell affect the seafloor?
Options:(A) It creates seafloor at a mid-ocean ridge (B) It creates a transform fault in the seafloor (C) It drags seafloor into the mantle at a trench (D) None of the above
Answer:",C
777,"Context: Earthquakes also occur at divergent plate boundaries. At mid-ocean ridges, these earthquakes tend to be small and shallow focus because the plates are thin, young, and hot. Earthquakes in the oceans are usually far from land, so they have little effect on peoples lives. On land, where continents are rifting apart, earthquakes are larger and stronger. 
Question: earthquakes occur at all plate boundaries.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",A
778,"Context: Earths crust consists of many tectonic plates that move over time. Due to plate tectonics, the continents changed their shapes and positions during Earth history. As the continents changed, so did the oceans. About 250 million years ago, there was one huge land mass known as Pangaea. There was also one huge ocean called Panthalassa. You can see it in Figure 14.2. By 180 million years ago, Pangaea began to break up. The continents started to drift apart. They slowly moved to where they are today. The movement of the continents caused Panthalassa to break into smaller oceans. These oceans are now known as the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic Oceans. The waters of all the oceans are connected. 
Question: a single plate can only be made of either continental or oceanic crust.
Options:(A) True (B) False

Answer:",A
781,"Context: The seafloor spreading hypothesis brought all of these observations together in the early 1960s. Hot mantle material rises up at mid-ocean ridges. The hot magma erupts as lava. The lava cools to form new seafloor. Later, more lava erupts at the ridge. The new lava pushes the seafloor that is at the ridge horizontally away from ridge axis. The seafloor moves! In some places, the oceanic crust comes up to a continent. The moving crust pushes that continent away from the ridge axis as well. If the moving oceanic crust reaches a deep sea trench, the crust sinks into the mantle. The creation and destruction of oceanic crust is the reason that continents move. Seafloor spreading is the mechanism that Wegener was looking for! 
Question: seafloor is created from and then recycled back into the mantle.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",A
782,"Context: Mafic magma creates gentler effusive eruptions. Although the pressure builds enough for the magma to erupt, it does not erupt with the same explosive force as felsic magma. Magma pushes toward the surface through fissures. Eventually, the magma reaches the surface and erupts through a vent (Figure 1.1). Effusive eruptions are common in Hawaii, where lavas are mafic. In effusive eruptions, lava flows readily, producing rivers of molten rock. A Quicktime movie with thermal camera of a lava stream within the vent of a Hawaiian volcano is seen here:

788,"Context: Low-viscosity lava flows down mountainsides. Differences in composition and where the lavas erupt result in three types of lava flow coming from effusive eruptions. Aa lava forms a thick and brittle crust that is torn into rough and jagged pieces. Aa lava can spread over large areas as the lava continues to flow underneath the crusts surface. Pahoehoe lava forms lava tubes where fluid lava flows through the outer cooled rock crust. Pahoehoe lava is less viscous than aa lava, so its surface looks is smooth and ropy. Mafic lava that erupts underwater creates pillow lava. The lava cools very quickly, forming roughly spherical rocks. Pillow lava is common at mid-ocean ridges (Figure (a) Aa lava spread over large areas. (b) Pahoehoe lava tubes where at the Thurston Lava Tube in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. (c) Pahoehoe lava is less viscous than aa lava so its surface looks is smooth and ropy. (d) Pillow lava.

791,"Context: The earliest cells were prokaryotes (Figure 1.1). Although prokaryotes have a cell membrane, they lack a cell nucleus and other organelles. Without a nucleus, RNA was loose within the cell. Over time the cells became more complex. LUCA was a prokaryote but differed from the first living cells because its genetic code was based on DNA. The oldest fossils are tiny microbe-like objects that are 3.5 billion years old. Evidence for bacteria, the first single-celled life forms, goes back 3.5 billion years (Figure 1.2). 
Question: the earliest cells may have formed when
Options:(A) Organic molecules adhered to clay minerals (B) Clay minerals developed the ability to replicate (C) Metal cations combined with organic molecules (D) None of these
Answer:",A
792,"Context: Simple organic molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids eventually became complex organic substances. Sci- entists think that the organic molecules adhered to clay minerals, which provided the structure needed for these substances to organize. The clays, along with their metal cations, catalyzed the chemical reactions that caused the molecules to form polymers. The first RNA fragments could also have come together on ancient clays. E. coli (Escherichia coli) is a primitive prokaryote that may resemble the earliest cells. For an organic molecule to become a cell, it must be able to separate itself from its environment. To enclose the molecule, a lipid membrane grew around the organic material. Eventually the molecules could synthesize their own organic material and replicate themselves. These became the first cells. 
Question: for organic molecules to become a cell they had to
Options:(A) Separate themselves from their environment with a membrane (B) Synthesize their own organic material (C) Replicate themselves (D) All of these

793,"Context: What were these organisms that completely changed the progression of life on Earth by changing the atmosphere from anaerobic to aerobic? The oldest known fossils that are from organisms known to photosynthesize are cyanobac- teria. Cyanobacteria were present by 2.8 billion years ago, and some may have been around as far back as 3.5 billion years. Cyanobacteria were the dominant life forms in the Archean. Why would such a primitive life-form have been dominant in the Precambrian? Many cyanobacteria lived in reef-like structures known as stromatolites (Figure These rocks in Glacier National Park, Montana may contain some of the oldest fossil microbes on Earth. Modern cyanobacteria are also called blue-green algae. These organisms may consist of a single or many cells and they are found in many different environments (Figure 1.5). Even now cyanobacteria account for 20% to 30% of photosynthesis on Earth. A large bloom of cyanobacteria is harmful to this lake.

795,"Context: Early cells took nutrients from the water. Eventually the nutrients would have become less abundant. Around 3 billion years ago, photosynthesis began. Organisms could make their own food from sunlight and inorganic molecules. From these ingredients they made chemical energy that they used. Oxygen is a waste product of photosynthesis. That first oxygen combined with iron to create iron oxide. Later on, the oxygen entered the atmosphere. Some of the oxygen in the atmosphere became ozone. The ozone layer formed to protect Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. This made the environment able to support more complex life forms.

799,"Context: In what two ways did photosynthesis make the planet much more favorable for life? 1. Photosynthesis allowed organisms to create food energy so that they did not need to rely on nutrients floating around in the environment. Photosynthesizing organisms could also become food for other organisms. 2. A byproduct of photosynthesis is oxygen. When photosynthesis evolved, all of a sudden oxygen was present in large amounts in the atmosphere. For organisms used to an anaerobic environment, the gas was toxic, and many organisms died out.

805,"Context: A large explosive eruption creates even more devastation than the force of the atom bomb dropped on Nagasaki at the end of World War II, in which more than 40,000 people died. A large explosive volcanic eruption is 10,000 times as powerful. Explosive eruptions are found at the convergent plate boundaries that line parts of western North America, resulting in the Cascades in the Pacific Northwest and the Aleutians in Alaska. 
Question: most explosive eruptions take place at
Options:(A) Subduction zones (B) Hotspots (C) Divergent plate boundaries (D) Transform plate boundaries
Answer:",A
806,"Context: Convergent plate boundaries also produce strong, deadly earthquakes. Earthquakes mark the motions of colliding plates and the locations where plates plunge into the mantle. These earthquakes can be shallow, intermediate or deep focus. The Philippine plate and the Pacific plate subduct beneath Japan, creating as many as 1,500 earthquakes every year. In March 2011, the 9.0 magnitude Tohoku earthquake struck off of northeastern Japan. Damage from the quake was severe. More severe was the damage from the tsunami generated by the quake (Figure 7.25). In all, 25,000 people were known dead or missing. The Cascades Volcanoes line the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Here, the Juan de Fuca plate subducts beneath the North American plate. The Cascades volcanoes are active and include Mount Saint Helens. Major earthquakes occur here approximately every 300 to 600 years. The last was in 1700. Its magnitude was between 8.7 and 9.2. It has now been more than 300 years since that earthquake. The next massive earthquake could strike the Pacific Northwest at any time.

811,"Context: A mineral deposit that contains enough minerals to be mined for profit is called an ore. Ores are rocks that contain concentrations of valuable minerals. The bauxite shown in the Figure 3.21 is a rock that contains minerals that are used to make aluminum. 
Question: a rock that contains material with useful elements for human is called a/an
Options:(A) Ore (B) Mineral (C) Fossil (D) Element
Answer:",A
812,"Context: Some minerals are very useful. An ore is a rock that contains minerals with useful elements. Aluminum in bauxite ore (Figure 1.1) is extracted from the ground and refined to be used in aluminum foil and many other products. The cost of creating a product from a mineral depends on how abundant the mineral is and how much the extraction and refining processes cost. Environmental damage from these processes is often not figured into a products cost. It is important to use mineral resources wisely. 
Question: aluminum foil is made of valuable minerals in bauxite ore.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",A
813,"Context: Geologic processes create and concentrate minerals that are valuable natural resources. Geologists study geological formations and then test the physical and chemical properties of soil and rocks to locate possible ores and determine their size and concentration. A mineral deposit will only be mined if it is profitable. A concentration of minerals is only called an ore deposit if it is profitable to mine. There are many ways to mine ores. Aluminum is made from the aluminum- bearing minerals in bauxite.

815,"Context: Most minerals are a combination of metal and other elements. The rocks that are taken from a mine are full of valuable minerals plus rock that isnt valuable. This is called waste rock. The valuable minerals must be separated from the waste rock. One way to do this is with a chemical reaction. Chemicals are added to the ores at very high temperatures. For example, getting aluminum from waste rock uses a lot of energy. This is because temperatures greater than 900o C are needed to separate out the aluminum. It also takes a huge amount of electricity. If you recycle just 40 aluminum cans, you will save the energy in one gallon of gasoline. We use over 80 billion cans each year. If all of these cans were recycled, we would save the energy in 2 billion gallons of gasoline! 
Question: remove valuable minerals from waste rock requires
Options:(A) Roasting (B) Toxic chemicals (C) Flotation (D) All of these
Answer:",D
816,"Context: Surface mining is used to obtain mineral ores that are near the surface. Blasting breaks up the soil and rocks that contain the ore. Enormous trucks haul the broken rocks to locations where the ores can be removed. Surface mining includes open-pit mining, quarrying, and strip mining. As the name suggests, open-pit mining creates a big pit from which the ore is mined. Figure 3.22 shows an open-pit diamond mine in Russia. The size of the pit grows as long as the miners can make a profit. Strip mines are similar to open-pit mines, but the ore is removed in large strips. A quarry is a type of open-pit mine that produces rocks and minerals that are used to make buildings and roads.

818,"Context: Placer minerals collect in stream gravels. They can be found in modern rivers or ancient riverbeds. California was nicknamed the Golden State. This can be traced back to the discovery of placer gold in 1848. The amount of placer gold brought in miners from around the world. The gold formed in rocks in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The rocks also contained other valuable minerals. The gold weathered out of the hard rock. It washed downstream and then settled in gravel deposits along the river. Currently, California has active gold and silver mines. California also has mines for non-metal minerals. For example, sand and gravel are mined for construction. 
Question: when valuable minerals are taken from stream gravels, this is called

Answer:",B
819,"Context: Underground mining is used to recover ores that are deeper into Earths surface. Miners blast and tunnel into rock to gain access to the ores. How underground mining is approached  from above, below, or sideways  depends on the placement of the ore body, its depth, the concentration of ore, and the strength of the surrounding rock. Underground mining is very expensive and dangerous. Fresh air and lights must also be brought into the tunnels for the miners, and accidents are far too common. 
Question: when miners blast and tunnel into rock to gain access to ores, this is called ____________.
Options:(A) Underground mining (B) Surface mining (C) Mine blowing (D) Strip mining

820,"Context: The first photo above is of a volcanic eruption in Hawaii. Hawaii is not in western North America, but is in the central Pacific ocean, near the middle of the Pacific Plate. The Hawaiian Islands are a beautiful example of a hotspot chain in the Pacific Ocean. Kilauea volcano lies above the Hawaiian hotspot. Mauna Loa volcano is older than Kilauea and is still erupting, but at a slower rate. The islands get progressively older to the northwest because they are further from the hotspot. This is because the Pacific Plate is moving toward the northwest over the hotspot. Loihi, the youngest volcano, is still below the sea surface. Since many hotspots are stationary in the mantle, geologists can use some hotspot chains to tell the direction and the speed a plate is moving (Figure 1.2). The Hawaiian chain continues into the Emperor Seamounts. The bend in the chain was caused by a change in the direction of the Pacific Plate 43 million years ago. Using the age and distance of the bend, geologists can figure out the speed of the Pacific Plate over the hotspot. The Hawaiian Islands have formed from volcanic eruptions above the Hawaii hotspot. 
Question: loihi is actively erupting and is not an island yet, kilauea is actively erupting, mauna loa erupts some, and mauna kea erupts rarely. why the difference?
Options:(A) Loihi and Kilauea are on the hotspot (B) Mauna Loa is moving off (C) and Mauna Kea has (D) b This pattern is random and will change over time (E) c The volcanoes that are erupting less are on the hotspot and Loihi and Kilauea are moving off the hotspot (F) d None of the above

821,"Context: Most geological activity takes place at plate boundaries. But some activity does not. Much of this intraplate activity is found at hot spots. Hotspot volcanoes form as plumes of hot magma rise from deep in the mantle. 
Question: geologic activity that takes place away from the plate boundary.
Options:(A) Divergent activity (B) Strike-slip activity (C) Intraplate activity (D) Conplate activity
Answer:",C
822,"Context: A small amount of geologic activity, known as intraplate activity, does not take place at plate boundaries but within a plate instead. Mantle plumes are pipes of hot rock that rise through the mantle. The release of pressure causes melting near the surface to form a hotspot. Eruptions at the hotspot create a volcano. Hotspot volcanoes are found in a line (Figure 1.1). Can you figure out why? Hint: The youngest volcano sits above the hotspot and volcanoes become older with distance from the hotspot. 
Question: a plume of hot material that results in intraplate volcanic activity is a

Answer:",A
823,"Context: A chain of volcanoes forms as an oceanic plate moves over a hot spot. This is how it happens. A volcano forms over the hotspot. Since the plate is moving, the volcano moves off of the hotspot. When the hotspot erupts again, a new volcano forms over it. This volcano is in line with the first. Over time, there is a line of volcanoes. The youngest is directly above the hot spot. The oldest is the furthest away (Figure 6.27). The Hawaii-Emperor chain of volcanoes formed over the Hawaiian Hotspot. The Hawaiian Islands formed most

825,"Context: Hot spots are also found under the continental crust. Since it is more difficult for magma to make it through the thick crust, they are much less common. One exception is the Yellowstone hotspot (Figure 6.28). This hotspot is very active. In the past, the hotspot produced enormous volcanic eruptions. Now its activity is best seen in the regions famous geysers. 
Question: hotspot volcanoes are only found on oceanic crust.

Answer:",B
826,"Context: Plate boundaries are where two plates meet. Most geologic activity takes place at plate boundaries. This activity includes volcanoes, earthquakes, and mountain building. The activity occurs as plates interact. How can plates interact? Plates can move away from each other. They can move toward each other. Finally, they can slide past each other. These are the three types of plate boundaries: Divergent plate boundaries: the two plates move away from each other. Convergent plate boundaries: the two plates move towards each other. Transform plate boundaries: the two plates slip past each other. The features that form at a plate boundary are determined by the direction of plate motion and by the type of crust at the boundary. 
Question: all of the major geological activity takes place along plate boundaries.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
827,"Context: The next breakthrough in the development of the theory of plate tectonics came two decades after Wegeners death. Magnetite crystals are shaped like a tiny bar magnet. As basalt lava cools, the magnetite crystals line up in the magnetic field like tiny magnets. When the lava is completely cooled, the crystals point in the direction of magnetic north pole at the time they form. How do you expect this would help scientists see whether continents had moved or not? As a Wegener supporter, (and someone who is omniscient), you have just learned of a new tool that may help you. A magnetometer is a device capable of measuring the magnetic field intensity. This allows you to look at the magnetic properties of rocks in many locations. First, youre going to look at rocks on land. Which rocks should you seek out for study? 
Question: scientists use rocks from hotspot volcanoes to tell the speed a plate is traveling. for this to be accurate, what must be true?
Options:(A) The volcanoes must erupt at the same rate (B) The plate must be traveling at a constant speed (C) The hotspot must not move in the mantle (D) The hotspot must put out lava at a constant speed

Answer:",D
841,"Context: Landslides cause $1 billion to $2 billion damage in the United States each year and are responsible for traumatic and sudden loss of life and homes in many areas of the world. Some at-risk communities have developed landslide warning systems. Around San Francisco Bay, the National Weather Service and the U.S. Geological Survey use rain gauges to monitor soil moisture. If soil becomes saturated, the weather service issues a warning. Earthquakes, which may occur on Californias abundant faults, can also trigger landslides. To be safe from landslides: Be aware of your surroundings and notice changes in the natural world. Look for cracks or bulges in hillsides, tilting of decks or patios, or leaning poles or fences when rainfall is heavy. Sticking windows and doors can indicate ground movement as soil pushes slowly against a house and knocks windows and doors out of alignment. Look for landslide scars because landslides are most likely to happen where they have occurred before. Plant vegetation and trees on the hillside around your home to help hold soil in place.

843,"Context: Landslides are the most dramatic, sudden, and dangerous examples of Earth materials moved by gravity. Landslides are sudden falls of rock; by contrast, avalanches are sudden falls of snow. When large amounts of rock suddenly break loose from a cliff or mountainside, they move quickly and with tremendous force (Figure 1.1). Air trapped under the falling rocks acts as a cushion that keeps the rock from slowing down. Landslides can move as fast as 200 to 300 km/hour. This landslide in California in 2008 blocked Highway 140. Landslides are exceptionally destructive. Homes may be destroyed as hillsides collapse. Landslides can even bury entire villages. Landslides may create lakes when the rocky material dams a stream. If a landslide flows into a lake or bay, they can trigger a tsunami. Landslides often occur on steep slopes in dry or semi-arid climates. The California coastline, with its steep cliffs and years of drought punctuated by seasons of abundant rainfall, is prone to landslides. 
Question: which of the following is not true about landslides?
Options:(A) Landslides are most likely to happen in a wet year that was proceeded by dry years (B) Landslides may destroy a small community (C) Landslides may move so fast because they ride on a cushion of air (D) Landslides are most common in forested regions
Answer:",D
844,"Context: Added water creates natural hazards produced by gravity (Figure 1.2). On hillsides with soils rich in clay, little rain, and not much vegetation to hold the soil in place, a time of high precipitation will create a mudflow. Mudflows follow river channels, washing out bridges, trees, and homes that are in their path. A lahar is mudflow that flows down a composite volcano (Figure 1.3). Ash mixes with snow and ice melted by the eruption to produce hot, fast-moving flows. The lahar caused by the eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in Columbia in 1985 killed more than 23,000 people.

847,"Context: Creep is the very slow movement of rock and soil down a hillside. Creep occurs so slowly you cant see it happening. You can only see the effects of creep after years of movement. This is illustrated in Figure 10.33. The slowly moving ground causes trees, fence posts, and other structures on the surface to tilt downhill. Creep usually takes place where the ground freezes and thaws frequently. Soil and rock particles are lifted up when the ground freezes. When the ground thaws, the particles settle down again. Each time they settle down, they move a tiny bit farther down the slope because of gravity. 
Question: what are the signs of creep?

Question: the main characteristics of the asthenosphere are that it is a
Options:(A) Brittle solid (B) Solid that can behave plastically (C) Liquid (D) None of these
Answer:",B
853,"Context: The lithosphere is composed of both the crust and the portion of the upper mantle that behaves as a brittle, rigid solid. The lithosphere is the outermost mechanical layer, which behaves as a brittle, rigid solid. The lithosphere is about 100 kilometers thick. How are crust and lithosphere different from each other? The definition of the lithosphere is based on how Earth materials behave, so it includes the crust and the uppermost mantle, which are both brittle. Since it is rigid and brittle, when stresses act on the lithosphere, it breaks. This is what we experience as an earthquake. Although we sometimes refer to Earths plates as being plates of crust, the plates are actually made of lithosphere. Much more about Earths plates follows in the chapter ""Plate Tectonics."" 
Question: how are the crust and lithosphere different from each other?
Options:(A) The lithosphere is in the mantle and the crust is the crust (B) The lithosphere is a solid that can behave plastically and the crust is brittle (C) The crust is made of rocks of more different compositions than the lithosphere (D) The lithosphere includes the crust and also the uppermost mantle

Answer:",B
856,"Context: Crust, mantle, and core differ from each other in chemical composition. Its understandable that scientists know the most about the crust, and less about deeper layers (Figure 6.3). Earths crust is a thin, brittle outer shell. The crust is made of rock. This layer is thinner under the oceans and much thicker in mountain ranges.

Answer:",A
857,"Context: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur (Figure 7.21). 
Question: stresses on the lithosphere may cause it to break and cause an earthquake.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",A
858,"Context: Lithosphere and asthenosphere are divisions based on mechanical properties: 1. The lithosphere is composed of both the crust and the portion of the upper mantle and behaves as a brittle, rigid solid. 2.

859,"Context: One seismogram indicates the distance to the epicenter. This is determined by the P-and S-wave arrival times. If a quake is near the seismograph, the S-waves arrive shortly after the P-waves. If a quake is far from the seismograph, the P-waves arrive long before the S-waves. The longer the time is between the P-and S-wave arrivals, the further away the earthquake was from the seismograph. First, seismologists calculate the arrival time difference. Then they know the distance to the epicenter from that seismograph. Next, the seismologists try to determine the location of the earthquake epicenter. To do this they need the distances to the epicenter from at least three seismographs. Lets say that they know that an earthquakes epicenter is 50 kilometers from Kansas City.

863,"Context: Earthquakes in Japan are caused by ocean-ocean convergence. The Philippine Plate and the Pacific Plate subduct beneath oceanic crust on the North American or Eurasian plates. This complex plate tectonics situation creates a chain of volcanoes, the Japanese islands, and as many as 1,500 earthquakes annually. In March 2011 an enormous 9.0 earthquake struck off of Sendai in northeastern Japan. This quake, called the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, was the most powerful ever to strike Japan and one of the top five known in the world. Damage from the earthquake was nearly overshadowed by the tsunami it generated, which wiped out coastal cities and towns This cross section of earthquake epicen- ters with depth outlines the subducting plate with shallow, intermediate, and deep earthquakes. (Figure 1.2). Several months after the earthquake, about 22,000 people were dead or missing, and 190,000 buildings had been damaged or destroyed. Aftershocks, some as large as major earthquakes, have continued to rock the region. Destruction in Ofunato, Japan, from the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake.

Answer:",C
864,"Context: The Japanese received a one-two punch in March 2011. The 2011 Tohoku earthquake offshore was a magnitude 9.0 and damage from the quake was extensive. People didnt have time to recover before massive tsunami waves hit the island nation. As seen in Figure 1.2, waves in some regions topped 9 meters (27 feet). The tsunami did much more damage than the massive earthquake (Figure 1.3). Worst was the damage done to nuclear power plants along the northeastern coast. Eleven reactors were automatically shut down. Power and backup power were lost at the Fukushima plant, leading to equipment failures, meltdowns, and the release of radioactive materials. Control and cleanup of the disabled plants will go on for many years.

866,"Context: Here are the steps to finding an earthquake epicenter using three seismograms: 1. Determine the epicenter distance from three different seismographs. The longer the time between the arrival of the P-wave and S-wave, the farther away is the epicenter. So the difference in the P- and S-wave arrival times determines the distance between the epicenter and a seismometer. 2. Draw a circle with a radius equal to the distance from the epicenter for that seismograph. The epicenter is somewhere along that circle. Do this for three locations. Using data from two seismographs, the two circles will intercept at two points. A third circle will intercept the other two circles at a single point.

869,"Context: Different factors play into the composition of a magma and the rock it produces. 
Question: knowing the magma composition will determine
Options:(A) Eruption style (B) Type of volcanic cone that will form (C) Composition of rock found at the volcano (D) All of the above
Answer:",D
870,"Context: Viscous lava flows slowly. If there is not enough magma or enough pressure to create an explosive eruption, the magma may form a lava dome. Because it is so thick, the lava does not flow far from the vent. (Figure 1.2). Lava flows often make mounds right in the middle of craters at the top of volcanoes, as seen in the Figure 1.3. A fissure eruption on Mauna Loa in Hawaii travels toward Mauna Kea on the Big Is- land. Lava domes are large, round landforms created by thick lava that does not travel far from the vent. Lava domes may form in the crater of composite volcanoes as at Mount St. He- lens. 
Question: felsic lava is more likely to stay deeper in the crust and cool slowly.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",A
871,"Context: Volcanoes rise where magma forms underground. Volcanoes are found at convergent plate boundaries and at hotspots. Volcanic activity is found at divergent plate boundaries. The map in Figure 8.1 shows where volcanoes are located. 
Question: this is a region below a volcano where magma and gases collect.
Options:(A) Magma chamber (B) Vent (C) Pipe (D) Crater
Answer:",A
872,"Context: There are as many types of volcanic eruptions as there are eruptions. Actually more since an eruption can change character as it progresses. Each volcanic eruption is unique, differing in size, style, and composition of erupted material. One key to what makes the eruption unique is the chemical composition of the magma that feeds a volcano, which determines (1) the eruption style, (2) the type of volcanic cone that forms, and (3) the composition of rocks that are found at the volcano. Different minerals within a rock melt at different temperatures. The amount of partial melting and the composition of the original rock determine the composition of the magma. The words that describe composition of igneous rocks also describe magma composition. Mafic magmas are low in silica and contain more dark, magnesium- and iron-rich mafic minerals, such as olivine and pyroxene. Felsic magmas are higher in silica and contain lighter colored minerals such as quartz and orthoclase feldspar. The higher the amount of silica in the magma, the higher is its viscosity. Viscosity is a liquids resistance to flow. Viscosity determines what the magma will do. Mafic magma is not viscous and will flow easily to the surface. Felsic magma is viscous and does not flow easily. Most felsic magma will stay deeper in the crust and will cool to form igneous intrusive rocks such as granite and granodiorite. If felsic magma rises into a magma chamber, it may be too viscous to move, so it gets stuck. Dissolved gases become trapped by thick magma. The magma churns in the chamber and the pressure builds. Magma collects in magma chambers in the crust at 160 kilometers (100 miles) beneath the surface. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: 
Question: if magma is high in silica and more viscous, what type of eruption will form?
Options:(A) Effusive (B) Explosive (C) Alternative (D) Pahoehoe
Answer:",B
873,"Context: The exact cause of supervolcano eruptions is still debated. However, scientists think that a very large magma chamber erupts entirely in one catastrophic explosion. This creates a huge hole or caldera into which the surface collapses (Figure 1.1). The caldera at Santorini in Greece is so large that it can only be seen by satellite. 
Question: what causes an eruption to take place?
Options:(A) The composition of the magma (B) The location of the magma beneath the volcano (C) The viscosity of the magma (D) The amount of dissolved gases that become trapped by the magma
Answer:",D
874,"Context: Imagine a rock that becomes so hot it melts. Many minerals start out in liquids that are hot enough to melt rocks. Magma is melted rock inside Earth, a molten mixture of substances that can be hotter than 1,000 C. Magma cools slowly inside Earth, which gives mineral crystals time to grow large enough to be seen clearly (Figure 1.1). Granite is rock that forms from slowly cooled magma, containing the minerals quartz (clear), plagioclase feldspar (shiny white), potassium feldspar (pink), and bi- otite (black). When magma erupts onto Earths surface, it is called lava. Lava cools much more rapidly than magma. Crystals do not have time to form and are very small. The chemical composition between minerals that form rapidly or slowly is often the same, only their size differs. Existing rocks may be heated enough so that the molecules are released from their structure and can move around. The molecules may match up with different molecules to form new minerals as the rock cools. This occurs during metamorphism, which will be discussed in the ""Metamorphic Rocks"" concept. 
Question: lava cools so quickly that there are never any visible mineral grains in it.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
875,"Context: Color may be the first feature you notice about a mineral, but color is not often important for mineral identification. For example, quartz can be colorless, purple (amethyst), or a variety of other colors depending on chemical impurities Figure 1.1. 
Question: if you find a light colored ash, containing minerals such as quartz, you know that this represents
Options:(A) A mafic magma that erupted effusively (B) A felsic magma that erupted effusively (C) A felsic magma that erupted explosively (D) A mafic magma that erupted explosively

Sunlight and wind are renewable resources because they will not be used up ( Figure 1.1). The rising and falling of ocean tides is another example of a resource in unlimited supply. A sustainable resource is a resource that is used in a way that meets the needs of the present without keeping future generations from meeting their needs. People can sustainably harvest wood, cork, and bamboo. Farmers can also grow crops sustainably by not planting the same crop in their soil year after year. Planting the same crop each year can remove nutrients from the soil. This means that wood, cork, bamboo, and crops can be sustainable resources.

883,"Context: Reusing means to use an item again rather than throwing it away and replacing it. Items can be reused for the same purpose or for a different purpose. Generally, it takes less energy to reuse an item than to recycle it, so choose this option over recycling when you can. Here are some specific tips for reusing natural resources: Consider mending or repairing worn or broken items rather than throwing them out and replacing them. Shop with reuse in mind. You can find great buys at flea markets and resale shops. You may be able to get free items online at free-cycle sites. Youll save money as well as natural resources. You can also sell (or give away) your own reusable items. Reuse cloth shopping bags. Instead of getting new plastic or paper bags for your purchases each time you shop, take your own reusable bag to the store each time. Even little steps can add up and help save natural resources. For example, unwrap gifts carefully and youll be able to reuse the gift wrap on a package for someone else. You can also reuse writing paper that has only been used on one side. Its great for notes and shopping lists.

888,"Context: Remember that the mid-ocean ridge is where hot mantle material upwells in a convection cell. The upwelling mantle melts due to pressure release to form lava. Lava flows at the surface cool rapidly to become basalt, but deeper in the crust, magma cools more slowly to form gabbro. The entire ridge system is made up of igneous rock that is either extrusive or intrusive. The seafloor is also igneous rock with some sediment that has fallen onto it. Earthquakes are common at mid-ocean ridges since the movement of magma and oceanic crust results in crustal shaking. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:

Answer:",C
890,"Context: At the end of the Paleozoic there was one continent and one ocean. When Pangaea began to break apart about 180 million years ago, the Panthalassa Ocean separated into the individual but interconnected oceans that we see today on Earth. The Atlantic Ocean basin formed as Pangaea split apart. The seafloor spreading that pushed Africa and South America apart is continuing to enlarge the Atlantic Ocean (Figure 1.1). As the continents moved apart there was an intense period of plate tectonic activity. Seafloor spreading was so vig- orous that the mid-ocean ridge buoyed upwards and displaced so much water that there was a marine transgression. Later in the Mesozoic those seas regressed and then transgressed again. 
Question: as pangaea broke apart,
Options:(A) Seafloor spreading was so vigorous that there was a marine transgression (B) The Panthalassa Ocean split into several separate and unconnected oceans (C) The Pacific Ocean basin formed between Africa and South America (D) All of the above
Answer:",A
891,"Context: Some of the most important events of the Paleozoic and Mesozoic were the rising and falling of sea level over the continents. Sea level rises over the land during a marine transgression. During a marine regression, sea level retreats. During the Paleozoic there were four complete cycles of marine transgressions and regressions. There were two additional cycles during the Mesozoic (Figure 1.1). One of two things must happen for sea level to change in a marine transgression: either the land must sink or the water level must rise. What could cause sea level to rise? When little or no fresh water is tied up in glaciers and ice caps, sea level is high. Sea level also appears to rise if land is down dropped. Sea level rises if an increase in seafloor spreading rate buoys up the ocean crust, causing the ocean basin to become smaller. What could cause sea level to fall in a marine regression? Six marine transgressions and regres- sions have occurred during the Phanero- zoic. Geologists think that the Paleozoic marine transgressions and regressions were the result of the decrease and increase in the size of glaciers covering the lands.

900,"Context: The sum of all of an organisms biochemical reactions is called metabolism. Biochemical reactions of metabolism can be divided into two general categories: catabolic reactions and anabolic reactions. You can watch an animation showing how the two categories of reactions are related at this link: Anabolic reactions involve forming bonds. Smaller molecules combine to form larger ones. These reactions require energy. For example, it takes energy to build starches from sugars. Catabolic reactions involve breaking bonds. Larger molecules break down to form smaller ones. These reactions release energy. For example, energy is released when starches break down to sugars.

907,"Context: Graphite is one of three forms of crystalline, or crystal-forming, carbon. Carbon also exists in an amorphous, or shapeless, form in substances such as coal and charcoal. Different forms of the same element are called allotropes. Besides graphite, the other allotropes of crystalline carbon are diamond and fullerenes. All three forms exist as crystals rather than molecules. In a crystal, many atoms are bonded together in a repeating pattern that may contains thousands of atoms. The arrangement of atoms in the crystal differs for each form of carbon and explains why the different forms have different properties. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Q: How do you think the properties of diamond might differ from the properties of graphite? A: Diamond is clear whereas graphite is black. Diamond is also very hard, so it doesnt break easily.

908,"Context: You are on vacation at the beach. You take your flip-flops off so you can go swimming. The sand is so hot it hurts your feet. You have to run to the water. Now imagine if it were hot enough for the sand to melt. Some places inside Earth are so hot that rock melts. Melted rock inside the Earth is called magma. Magma can be hotter than 1,000C. When magma erupts onto Earths surface, it is known as lava, as Figure 3.17 shows. Minerals form when magma and lava cool. 
Question: magma is melted rock outside of earth.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
909,"Context: Igneous rocks are called extrusive when they cool and solidify above the surface. These rocks usually form from a volcano, so they are also called volcanic rocks (Figure 1.3). Extrusive igneous rocks cool much more rapidly than intrusive rocks. There is little time for crystals to form, so extrusive igneous rocks have tiny crystals (Figure 1.4). Some volcanic rocks have a different texture. The rock has large crystals set within a matrix of tiny crystals. In this Extrusive igneous rocks form after lava cools above the surface. Cooled lava forms basalt with no visible crystals. Why are there no visible crys- tals? Cooling rate and gas content create other textures (see Figure 1.5 for examples of different textures). Lavas that cool extremely rapidly may have a glassy texture. Those with many holes from gas bubbles have a vesicular texture. Different cooling rate and gas content resulted in these different textures. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: 
Question: volcanic rocks have small or no crystals because they are from lava that cooled slowly.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
910,"Context: Whether rock melts to create magma depends on: Temperature: Temperature increases with depth, so melting is more likely to occur at greater depths. Pressure: Pressure increases with depth, but increased pressure raises the melting temperature, so melting is less likely to occur at higher pressures. Water: The addition of water changes the melting point of rock. As the amount of water increases, the melting point decreases. Rock composition: Minerals melt at different temperatures, so the temperature must be high enough to melt at least some minerals in the rock. The first mineral to melt from a rock will be quartz (if present) and the last will be olivine (if present). The different geologic settings that produce varying conditions under which rocks melt will be discussed in the chapter Plate Tectonics. 
Question: as a rock is heated, in what order do the minerals melt?
Options:(A) They melt from the rock in the same order that they formed as the magma cooled (B) The first ones to melt are the last ones that formed as the magma cooled (C) All of the minerals solidify and melt at the same time (D) The minerals melt in random order

911,"Context: In the last several years, many incredible discoveries have been made exploring how minerals behave under high pressure, like rocks experience inside the Earth. If a mineral is placed in a special machine and then squeezed, eventually it may convert into a different mineral. Ice is a classic example of a material that undergoes solid-solid ""phase transitions"" as pressure and/or temperature is changed. A ""phase diagram"" is a graph which plots the stability of phases of a compound as a function of pressure and temperature. A phase diagram for water (ice) is included in the Figure 1.6. The phase diagram is split up into 3 main areas for the solid crystalline phase (ice), the liquid phase (water), and the gas phase (water vapor).

912,"Context: When water evaporates, it leaves behind a solid precipitate of minerals, as shown in Figure 1.2. When the water in glass A evaporates, the dissolved mineral particles are left behind. Water can only hold a certain amount of dissolved minerals and salts. When the amount is too great to stay dissolved in the water, the particles come together to form mineral solids, which sink. Halite easily precipitates out of water, as does calcite. Some lakes, such as Mono Lake in California (Figure 1.3) or The Great Salt Lake in Utah, contain many mineral precipitates. Tufa towers form when calcium-rich spring water at the bottom of Mono Lake bubbles up into the alkaline lake. The tufa towers appear when lake level drops.

918,"Context: The roughly 1,000 silicate minerals make up over 90% of Earths crust. Silicates are by far the largest mineral group. Feldspar and quartz are the two most common silicate minerals. Both are extremely common rock-forming minerals. The basic building block for all silicate minerals is the silica tetrahedron, which is illustrated in Figure 1.1. To create the wide variety of silicate minerals, this pyramid-shaped structure is often bound to other elements, such as calcium, iron, and magnesium. Silica tetrahedrons combine together in six different ways to create different types of silicates (Figure 1.2). Tetrahe- drons can stand alone, form connected circles called rings, link into single and double chains, form large flat sheets of pyramids, or join in three dimensions. One silicon atom bonds to four oxygen atoms to form a silica tetrahedron. The different ways that silica tetrahedrons can join together cause these two minerals to look very different.

922,"Context: What do you guess carbonate minerals contain? If you guessed carbon, you would be right! All carbonates contain one carbon atom bonded to three oxygen atoms. Carbonates may include other elements. A few are calcium, iron, and copper. Carbonate minerals are often found where seas once covered the land. Some carbonate minerals are very common. Calcite contains calcium, carbon, and oxygen. Have you ever been in a limestone cave or seen a marble tile? Calcite is in both limestone and marble. Azurite and malachite are also carbonate minerals, but they contain copper instead of calcium. They are not as common as calcite. They are used in jewelry.

Silicates contain silicon atoms and oxygen atoms. One silicon atom is bonded to four oxygen atoms. These atoms form a pyramid (Figure 3.6). The silicate pyramid is the building block of silicate minerals. Most silicates contain other elements. These elements include calcium, iron, and magnesium. Silicate minerals are divided into six smaller groups. In each group, the silicate pyramids join together differently. The pyramids can stand alone. They can form into connected circles called rings. Some pyramids link into single and double chains. Others form large, flat sheets. Some join in three dimensions. Feldspar and quartz are the two most common silicates.

926,"Context: Breaking a mineral breaks its chemical bonds. Since some bonds are weaker than other bonds, each type of mineral is likely to break where the bonds between the atoms are weaker. For that reason, minerals break apart in characteristic ways. Cleavage is the tendency of a mineral to break along certain planes to make smooth surfaces. Halite (Figure 1.3) breaks between layers of sodium and chlorine to form cubes with smooth surfaces. Mica has cleavage in one direction and forms sheets (Figure 1.4). Minerals can cleave into polygons. Magnetite forms octahedrons (Figure 1.5). One reason gemstones are beautiful is that the cleavage planes make an attractive crystal shape with smooth faces. Fracture is a break in a mineral that is not along a cleavage plane. Fracture is not always the same in the same mineral because fracture is not determined by the structure of the mineral. Minerals may have characteristic fractures (Figure 1.6). Metals usually fracture into jagged edges. If a mineral splinters like wood, it may be fibrous. Some minerals, such as quartz, form smooth curved surfaces when they fracture. Sheets of mica.

931,"Context: Luster describes the reflection of light off a minerals surface. Mineralogists have special terms to describe luster. One simple way to classify luster is based on whether the mineral is metallic or non-metallic. Minerals that are opaque and shiny, such as pyrite, have a metallic luster. Minerals such as quartz have a non-metallic luster. Different types of non-metallic luster are described in Table 1.1. Luster Adamantine Earthy Pearly Resinous Silky Vitreous Appearance Sparkly Dull, clay-like Pearl-like Like resins, such as tree sap Soft-looking with long fibers Glassy The streak of hematite across an unglazed porcelain plate is red-brown.

933,"Context: The strength of an acid depends on how many hydrogen ions it produces when it dissolves in water. A stronger acid produces more hydrogen ions than a weaker acid. For example, sulfuric acid (H2 SO4 ), which is found in car batteries, is a strong acid because nearly all of it breaks down into ions when it dissolves in water. On the other hand, acetic acid (CH3 CO2 H), which is the acid in vinegar, is a weak acid because less than 1 percent of it breaks down into ions in water. The strength of a base depends on how many hydroxide ions it produces when it dissolves in water. A stronger base produces more hydroxide ions than a weaker base. For example, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a base in drain cleaner, is a strong base because all of it breaks down into ions when it dissolves in water. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3 ), a base in antacids, is a weak base because only a small percentage of it breaks down into ions in water. 
Question: the main mineral that bubbles when a weak acid is put on it is
Options:(A) Magnetite (B) Calcite (C) Quartz (D) Gold
Answer:",B
934,"Context: Diamond is a form of carbon in which each carbon atom is covalently bonded to four other carbon atoms. This forms a strong, rigid, three-dimensional structure (see Figure 1.1). Diamond is the hardest natural substance, and no other natural substance can scratch it. This property makes diamonds useful for cutting and grinding tools as well as for rings and other jewelry (see Figure 1.2). 
Question: diamond is the hardest mineral.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",A
935,"Context: Color may be the first feature you notice about a mineral, but color is not often important for mineral identification. For example, quartz can be colorless, purple (amethyst), or a variety of other colors depending on chemical impurities Figure 1.1. 
Question: which of these descriptions does not identify gold?
Options:(A) High density (B) Shiny surfaces (C) Reacts with acid (D) Distinctive color
Answer:",C
936,"Context: Minerals are everywhere! Scientists have identified more than 4,000 minerals in Earths crust, although the bulk of the planet is composed of just a few. A mineral possesses the following qualities: It must be solid. It must be crystalline, meaning it has a repeating arrangement of atoms. It must be naturally occurring. It must be inorganic. It must have a specific chemical composition. Minerals can be identified by their physical properties, such as hardness, color, luster (shininess), and odor. The most common laboratory technique used to identify a mineral is X-ray diffraction (XRD), a technique that involves shining an X-ray light on a sample, and observing how the light exiting the sample is bent. XRD is not useful in the field, however. The definition of a mineral is more restricted than you might think at first. For example, glass is made of sand, which is rich in the mineral quartz. But glass is not a mineral, because it is not crystalline. Instead, glass has a random assemblage of molecules. What about steel? Steel is made by mixing different metal minerals like iron, cobalt, chromium, vanadium, and molybdenum, but steel is not a mineral because it is made by humans and therefore is not naturally occurring. However, almost any rock you pick up is composed of minerals. Below we explore the qualities of minerals in more detail. 
Question: minerals must possess which of the following qualities:
Options:(A) Must be a solid (B) Naturally occurring (C) Inorganic (D) All of the above
Answer:",D
937,"Context: Some minerals have other unique properties, some of which are listed in Table 1.3.

938,"Context: Minerals are ""crystalline"" solids. A crystal is a solid in which the atoms are arranged in a regular, repeating pattern. Notice that in Figure 1.1 the green and purple spheres, representing sodium and chlorine, form a repeating pattern. In this case, they alternate in all directions. Sodium ions (purple balls) bond with chlo- ride ions (green balls) to make table salt (halite). All of the grains of salt that are in a salt shaker have this crystalline structure. 
Question: a crystal is a solid in which atoms are arranged in a regular, repeating pattern.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",A
939,"Context: Minerals are made by natural processes. The processes that make minerals happen in or on the Earth. For example, when hot lava cools, mineral crystals form. Minerals also precipitate from water. Some minerals grow when rocks are exposed to high pressures and temperatures. Could something like a mineral be made by a process that was not natural? People make gemstones in a laboratory. Synthetic diamond is a common one. But that stone is not a mineral. It was not formed by a natural process. 
Question: organic minerals are made by a natural process.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
940,"Context: All minerals have a definite chemical makeup. A few minerals are made of only one kind of element. Silver is a mineral made only of silver atoms. Diamond and graphite are both made only of the element carbon. Minerals that are not pure elements are made of chemical compounds. For example, the mineral quartz is made of the compound silicon dioxide, or SiO2 . This compound has one atom of the element silicon for every two atoms of the element oxygen. Each mineral has its own unique chemical formula. For example, the mineral hematite has two iron atoms for every three oxygen atoms. The mineral magnetite has three iron atoms for every four oxygen atoms. Many minerals have very complex chemical formulas that include several elements. However, even in more complicated compounds, the elements occur in definite ratios. 
Question: four substances are described correctly, but only one is a mineral. which one is the mineral?
Options:(A) Steel because people make it by mixing the metal minerals like iron (B) Volcanic glass because it is a naturally occurring random assemblage of molecules (C) Table salt because it has a definite crystal structure of sodium and chlorine ions (D) A crystallized fossil bone because it is made of minerals
Answer:",C
941,"Context: Fracture describes how a mineral breaks without any pattern. A fracture is uneven. The surface is not smooth and flat. You can learn about a mineral from the way it fractures. If a mineral splinters like wood, it may be fibrous. Some minerals, such as quartz, fracture to form smooth, curved surfaces. A mineral that broke forming a smooth, curved surface is shown in Figure 3.16. 
Question: fracture describes the way a mineral breaks along planes of weakness.

Answer:",B
942,"Context: A rock is a naturally formed, non-living Earth material. Rocks are made of collections of mineral grains that are held together in a firm, solid mass (Figure 1.1). How is a rock different from a mineral? Rocks are made of minerals. The mineral grains in a rock may be so tiny that you can only see them with a microscope, or they may be as big as your fingernail or even your finger (Figure Rocks are identified primarily by the minerals they contain and by their texture. Each type of rock has a distinctive set of minerals. A rock may be made of grains of all one mineral type, such as quartzite. Much more commonly, rocks are made of a mixture of different minerals. Texture is a description of the size, shape, and arrangement of mineral grains. Are the two samples in Figure 1.3 the same rock type? Do they have the same minerals? The same texture? The different colors and textures seen in this rock are caused by the presence of different minerals. A pegmatite from South Dakota with crystals of lepidolite, tourmaline, and quartz (1 cm scale on the upper left). Sample 2 Crystals are tiny or microscopic Magma erupted and cooled quickly Andesite As seen in Table 1.1, these two rocks have the same chemical composition and contain mostly the same minerals, but they do not have the same texture. Sample 1 has visible mineral grains, but Sample 2 has very tiny or invisible grains. The two different textures indicate different histories. Sample 1 is a diorite, a rock that cooled slowly from magma (molten rock) underground. Sample 2 is an andesite, a rock that cooled rapidly from a very similar magma that erupted onto Earths surface. A few rocks are not made of minerals because the material they are made of does not fit the definition of a mineral. Coal, for example, is made of organic material, which is not a mineral.

943,"Context: The density of matter is actually the amount of matter in a given space. The amount of matter is measured by its mass. The space matter takes up is measured by its volume. Therefore, the density of matter can be calculated with this formula: Density = mass volume Assume, for example, that a book has a mass of 500 g and a volume of 1000 cm3 . Then the density of the book is: Density = 500 g = 0.5 g/cm3 1000 cm3 Q: What is the density of a liquid that has a volume of 30 mL and a mass of 300 g? A: The density of the liquid is: Density = 300 g = 10 g/mL 30 mL

944,"Context: Nearly all (98.5%) of Earths crust is made up of only eight elements - oxygen, silicon, aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium - and these are the elements that make up most minerals. All minerals have a specific chemical composition. The mineral silver is made up of only silver atoms and diamond is made only of carbon atoms, but most minerals are made up of chemical compounds. Each mineral has its own chemical formula. Table salt (also known as halite), pictured in Figure 1.1, is NaCl (sodium chloride). Quartz is always made of two oxygen atoms (red) bonded to a silicon atom (grey), represented by the chemical formula SiO2 (Figure 1.2). Quartz is made of two oxygen atoms (red) bonded to a silicon atom (grey). In nature, things are rarely as simple as in the lab, and so it should not come as a surprise that some minerals have a range of chemical compositions. One important example in Earth science is olivine, which always has silicon and oxygen as well as some iron and magnesium, (Mg, Fe)2 SiO4 .

946,"Context: The moving continents collided with island arcs and microcontinents so that mountain ranges accreted onto the continents edges. The subduction of the oceanic Farallon plate beneath western North America during the late In the Afar Region of Ethiopia, Africa is splitting apart. Three plates are pulling away from a central point. Jurassic and early Cretaceous produced igneous intrusions and other structures. The intrusions have since been uplifted so that they are exposed in the Sierra Nevada Mountains (Figure 1.2).

Answer:",B
949,"Context: Two converging continental plates smash upwards to create gigantic mountain ranges (Figure 1.1). Stresses from this uplift cause folds, reverse faults, and thrust faults, which allow the crust to rise upwards. As was stated previously there is currently no mountain range of this type in the western U.S., but we can find one where India is pushing into Eurasia. (a) The worlds highest mountain range, the Himalayas, is growing from the colli- sion between the Indian and the Eurasian plates. (b) The crumpling of the Indian and Eurasian plates of continental crust creates the Himalayas. 
Question: the indian plate and eurasian plate converge to make this mountain range.
Options:(A) The Cascades (B) Appalachians (C) Himalayas (D) The Alps
Answer:",C
950,"Context: Mountain ranges also line the eastern edge of North America. But there are no active volcanoes or earthquakes. Where did those mountains come from? These mountains formed at a convergent plate boundary when Pangaea came together. About 200 million years ago these mountains were similar to the Himalayas today (Figure 6.26)! There were also earthquakes. 
Question: mountain ranges do not form at these convergent plate boundaries.

Answer:",D
953,"Context: Amazingly, even divergence can create mountain ranges. When tensional stresses pull crust apart, it breaks into blocks that slide up and drop down along normal faults. The result is alternating mountains and valleys, known as a basin-and-range (Figure 1.3). In basin-and-range, some blocks are uplifted to form ranges, known as horsts, and some are down-dropped to form basins, known as grabens. (a) Horsts and grabens.

954,"Context: Horsetails have hollow, ribbed stems and are often found in marshes ( Figure 1.4). Whorls of tiny leaves around the stem make the plant look like a horses tail, but these soon fall off and leave a hollow stem that can perform photosynthesis. This is unusual since photosynthesis most often occurs in leaves. The stems are rigid and rough to the touch because they are coated with a scratchy mineral. Because of their scratchy texture, these plants were once used as scouring pads for cleaning dishes.

958,"Context: There are times in Earth history when all of the continents came together to form a supercontinent. Supercontinents come together and then break apart. Pangaea was the last supercontinent on Earth, but it was not the first. The supercontinent before Pangaea is called Rodinia. Rodinia contained about 75% of the continental landmass that is present today. The supercontinent came together about 1.1 billion years ago. Rodinia was not the first supercontinent either. Scientists think that three supercontinents came before Rodina, making five so far in Earth history. 
Question: the name of the supercontinent that came together 300 million years ago.
Options:(A) Eurasia (B) Pangaea (C) Aegean (D) Rodinia
Answer:",B
959,"Context: Most of the worlds largest mountains form as plates collide at convergent plate boundaries. Continents are too buoyant to get pushed down into the mantle. So when the plates smash together, the crust crumples upwards. This creates mountains. Folding and faulting in these collision zones makes the crust thicker. The worlds highest mountain range, the Himalayas, is growing as India collides with Eurasia. About 80 million years ago, India was separated from Eurasia by an ocean (Figure 7.16). As the plates collided, pieces of the old seafloor were forced over the Asian continent. This old seafloor is now found high in the Himalayas (Figure 7.17).

963,"Context: Earths crust consists of many tectonic plates that move over time. Due to plate tectonics, the continents changed their shapes and positions during Earth history. As the continents changed, so did the oceans. About 250 million years ago, there was one huge land mass known as Pangaea. There was also one huge ocean called Panthalassa. You can see it in Figure 14.2. By 180 million years ago, Pangaea began to break up. The continents started to drift apart. They slowly moved to where they are today. The movement of the continents caused Panthalassa to break into smaller oceans. These oceans are now known as the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic Oceans. The waters of all the oceans are connected.

966,"Context: As temperatures increase, warm, moist air rises. These updrafts first form cumulus and then cumulonimbus clouds. Winds at the top of the troposphere blow the cloud top sideways to make the anvil shape that characterizes a cloud as a thunderhead. As water vapor condenses to form a cloud, the latent heat makes the air in the cloud warmer than the air outside the cloud. Water droplets and ice fly up through the cloud in updrafts. When these droplets get heavy enough, they fall. A mature thunderstorm with updrafts and downdrafts that reach the ground. This starts a downdraft, and soon there is a convection cell within the cloud. The cloud grows into a cumulonimbus

967,"Context: Why does it snow instead of rain? Air temperature determines which type of precipitation falls. Rain falls if the air temperature is above freezing (0 C or 32 F). Frozen precipitation falls if the air or ground is below freezing. Frozen precipitation may fall as snow, sleet, or freezing rain. You can see how the different types form in Figure Snow falls when water vapor condenses as ice crystals. The air temperature is below freezing all the way to the ground, so the ice crystals remain frozen. They fall as flakes. Sleet forms when snow melts as it falls through a layer of warm air and then refreezes. It turns into small, clear ice pellets as it passes through a cold layer near the ground. Freezing rain falls as liquid water. It freezes on contact with cold surfaces near the ground. It may cover everything with a glaze of ice.

974,"Context: Scientists are not able to predict earthquakes. Since nearly all earthquakes take place at plate boundaries, scientists can predict where an earthquake will occur (Figure 7.37). This information helps communities to prepare for an earthquake. For example, they can require that structures are built to be earthquake safe. Predicting when an earthquake will occur is much more difficult. Scientists can look at how often earthquakes have struck in the past. This does not allow an accurate prediction for the future. Small tremors, called foreshocks, often happen a short time before a major quake. The ground may also tilt as stress builds up in the rocks. Water levels in wells also change as groundwater moves through rock fractures. These do not usually allow accurate predictions. Folklore tells of animals behaving strangely just before an earthquake. Most people tell stories of these behaviors after the earthquake. Chinese scientists actively study the behavior of animals before earthquakes to see if there is a connection. So far nothing concrete has come of these studies. Once an earthquake has started, many actions must take place. Seismometers can detect P-waves a few seconds before more damaging S-waves and surface waves arrive. Although a few seconds is not much, computers can shut down gas mains and electrical transmission lines. They can initiate protective measures in chemical plants, nuclear power plants, mass transit systems, airports, and roadways. 
Question: what do scientists know when it comes to predicting an earthquake?
Options:(A) Where earthquakes have taken place (B) Where plate boundaries are (C) Where faults are active (D) All of the above
Answer:",D
975,"Context: Signs sometimes come before a large earthquake. Small quakes, called foreshocks, sometimes occur a few seconds to a few weeks before a major quake. However, many earthquakes do not have foreshocks, and small earthquakes are not necessarily followed by a large earthquake. Ground tilting, caused by the buildup of stress in the rocks, may precede a large earthquake, but not always. Water levels in wells fluctuate as water moves into or out of fractures before an earthquake. This is also an uncertain predictor of large earthquakes. The relative arrival times of P-waves and S-waves also decreases just before an earthquake occurs. Folklore tells of animals behaving erratically just before an earthquake. Mostly, these anecdotes are told after the earthquake. If indeed animals sense danger from earthquakes or tsunami, scientists do not know what it is they could be sensing, but they would like to find out. Earthquake prediction is very difficult and not very successful, but scientists are looking for a variety of clues in a variety of locations and to try to advance the field. 
Question: small quakes that occur before an earthquake.
Options:(A) Forequake (B) Aftershock (C) Foreshock (D) Primary Shock
Answer:",C
976,"Context: Scientists are not able to predict earthquakes. Since nearly all earthquakes take place at plate boundaries, scientists can predict where an earthquake will occur (Figure 7.37). This information helps communities to prepare for an earthquake. For example, they can require that structures are built to be earthquake safe. Predicting when an earthquake will occur is much more difficult. Scientists can look at how often earthquakes have struck in the past. This does not allow an accurate prediction for the future. Small tremors, called foreshocks, often happen a short time before a major quake. The ground may also tilt as stress builds up in the rocks. Water levels in wells also change as groundwater moves through rock fractures. These do not usually allow accurate predictions. Folklore tells of animals behaving strangely just before an earthquake.

Question: scientists are able to accurately predict when an earthquake will strike.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
977,"Context: How can scientists know if a model designed to predict the future is likely to be accurate, since it may not be possible to wait long enough to see if the prediction comes true? One way is to run the model using a time in the past as the starting point see if the model can accurately predict the present. A model that can successfully predict the present is more likely to be accurate when predicting the future. Many models are created on computers because only computers can handle and manipulate such enormous amounts of data. For example, climate models are very useful for trying to determine what types of changes we can expect as the composition of the atmosphere changes. A reasonably accurate climate model would be impossible on anything other than the most powerful computers. 
Question: scientists can predict
Options:(A) Where an earthquake will take place (B) When an earthquake will take place (C) The magnitude of the earthquake (D) All of these
Answer:",A
978,"Context: No scientist or government agency wants to announce an eruption and then be wrong. There is a very real cost and disruption to society during a large-scale evacuation. If the scientists are wrong, people would be less likely to evacuate the next time scientists predicted an eruption. But if scientists predict an eruption that does take place it could save many lives. 
Question: if an evacuation was ordered and the earthquake didnt happen, a lot of money would be spent and people would be annoyed.

Answer:",B
980,"Context: When an earthquake will occur is much more difficult to predict. Since stress on a fault builds up at the same rate over time, earthquakes should occur at regular intervals (Figure 1.2). But so far scientists cannot predict when quakes will occur even to within a few years. Click image to the left or use the URL below.

984,"Context: Volcanic eruptions can be devastating, particularly to the people who live close to volcanoes. Volcanologists study volcanoes to be able to predict when a volcano will erupt. Many changes happen when a volcano is about to erupt. 
Question: scientists can predict exactly when a volcanic eruption will take place.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
985,"Context: Explosive eruptions are caused by gas-rich, felsic magmas that churn within the magma chamber. When the pressure becomes too great the magma breaks through the rock above the chamber and explodes, just like when a cork is released from a bottle of champagne. Magma, rock, and ash burst upward in an enormous explosion (Figure 1.1). 
Question: magma and gas building up in a magma chamber before an eruption cause
Options:(A) Ground deformation (B) Dome formation (C) Lava flows (D) All of these
Answer:",A
986,"Context: Many pieces of evidence can mean that a volcano is about to erupt, but the time and magnitude of the eruption are difficult to pin down. This evidence includes the history of previous volcanic activity, earthquakes, slope deformation, and gas emissions. 
Question: which of these geological tools would not be useful for determining if a volcano might erupt?
Options:(A) Tiltmeter (B) Compass (C) Satellite (D) Seismograph

Answer:",D
989,"Context: Gases may be able to escape a volcano before magma reaches the surface. Scientists measure gas emissions in vents on or around the volcano. Gases, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2 ), carbon dioxide (CO2 ), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and even water vapor can be measured at the site (Figure 1.1) or, in some cases, from a distance using satellites. The amounts of gases and their ratios are calculated to help predict eruptions. Scientists monitoring gas emissions at Mount St. Helens. 
Question: gases that are emitted by a volcano include

Answer:",C
990,"Context: Scientists study a volcanos history to try to predict when it will next erupt. They want to know how long it has been since it last erupted. They also want to know the time span between its previous eruptions. Volcanoes can be active, dormant, or extinct (Figure 8.12). An active volcano may be currently erupting. Alter- natively, it may be showing signs that it will erupt in the near future. A dormant volcano no longer shows signs of activity. But it has erupted in recent history and will probably erupt again. An extinct volcano is one that has not erupted in recent history. Scientists think that it will probably not erupt again. Scientists watch both active and dormant volcanoes closely for signs that show they might erupt. 
Question: even if a volcano is dormant, scientists may still monitor it for an eruption.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",A
991,"Context: Moving magma shakes the ground, so the number and size of earthquakes increases before an eruption. A volcano that is about to erupt may produce a sequence of earthquakes. Scientists use seismographs that record the length and strength of each earthquake to try to determine if an eruption is imminent. 
Question: the number and the size of earthquakes decrease before a volcanic eruption.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
992,"Context: Prior to the Mount St. Helens eruption in 1980, the Lassen Peak eruption on May 22, 1915, was the most recent Cascades eruption. A column of ash and gas shot 30,000 feet into the air. This triggered a high-speed pyroclastic flow, which melted snow and created a volcanic mudflow known as a lahar. Lassen Peak currently has geothermal activity and could erupt explosively again. Mt. Shasta, the other active volcano in California, erupts every 600 to 800 years. An eruption would most likely create a large pyroclastic flow, and probably a lahar. Of course, Mt. Shasta could explode and collapse like Mt. Mazama in Oregon (Figure 1.4). Crater Lake fills the caldera of the col- lapsed Mt. Mazama, which erupted with 42 times more power than Mount St. He- lens in 1980. The bathymetry of the lake shows volcanic features such as cinder cones. 
Question: a visible sign that mount st. helens was about to erupt in may 1980 was
Options:(A) A dome growing on the top of the cone (B) Ash spewing out the top (C) A bulge on its north side (D) All of these
Answer:",C
993,"Context: Since volcanologists are usually uncertain about an eruption, officials may not know whether to require an evac- uation. If people are evacuated and the eruption doesnt happen, the people will be displeased and less likely to evacuate the next time there is a threat of an eruption.

994,"Context: This scale measures the total energy released by an earthquake. Moment magnitude is calculated from the area of the fault that is ruptured and the distance the ground moved along the fault. 
Question: this scale is based on the strength of an earthquake by the damage done.
Options:(A) Richter Magnitude (B) Moment Magnitude (C) Seismic Scale (D) Mercalli Intensity
Answer:",D
995,"Context: Which scale do you think is best? With the Richter scale, a single sharp jolt measures higher than a very long intense earthquake that releases more energy. The moment magnitude scale more accurately reflects the energy released and the damage caused. Most seismologists now use the moment magnitude scale. The way scientists measure earthquake intensity and the two most common scales, Richter and moment magnitude, are described in the video below. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: 
Question: what is the similarity between the richter scale and moment magnitude scale to measure an earthquake?
Options:(A) Both can measure all types of earthquakes (B) Both measure the total energy released (C) Both measure the largest jolt of energy released (D) Both measure the damage done
Answer:",A
996,"Context: Each year, more than 900,000 earthquakes are recorded. 150,000 of them are strong enough to be felt by people. About 18 each year are major, with a Richter magnitude of 7.0 to 7.9. Usually there is one earthquake with a magnitude of 8 to 8.9 each year. Earthquakes with a magnitude in the 9 range are rare. The United States Geological Survey lists five such earthquakes on the moment magnitude scale since 1900 (see Figure 7.36). All but one, the Great Indian Ocean Earthquake of 2004, occurred somewhere around the Pacific Ring of Fire. 
Question: there is not too much difference in magnitude of an earthquake between a 7.5 and an 8.5.
Options:(A) True (B) False

997,"Context: This scale measures the total energy released by an earthquake. Moment magnitude is calculated from the area of the fault that is ruptured and the distance the ground moved along the fault. 
Question: this scale measures the total amount of energy released by an earthquake.
Options:(A) Richter Magnitude (B) Moment Magnitude (C) Seismic Scale (D) Mercalli Intensity
Answer:",B
998,"Context: The ways seismologists measure an earthquake have changed over the decades. Initially, they could only measure what people felt and saw, the intensity. Now they can measure the energy released during the quake, the magnitude. Early in the 20th century, earthquakes were described in terms of what people felt and the damage that was done to buildings. The Mercalli Intensity Scale describes earthquake intensity. There are many problems with the Mercalli scale. The damage from an earthquake is affected by many things. Different people experience an earthquake differently. Using this scale, comparisons between earthquakes were difficult to make. A new scale was needed. 
Question: the best scale to measure an earthquake is the mercalli scale.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
999,"Context: The Richter scale and the moment magnitude scale are logarithmic scales. The amplitude of the largest wave increases ten times from one integer to the next. An increase in one integer means that thirty times more energy was released. These two scales often give very similar measurements. How does the amplitude of the largest seismic wave of a magnitude 5 earthquake compare with the largest wave of a magnitude 4 earthquake? How does it compare with a magnitude 3 quake? The amplitude of the largest seismic wave of a magnitude 5 quake is 10 times that of a magnitude 4 quake and 100 times that of a magnitude 3 quake. How does an increase in two integers on the moment magnitude scale compare in terms of the amount of energy released? Two integers equals a 900-fold increase in released energy. 
Question: a scale in which each unit is an exponential increase over the previous unit.

Answer:",B
1003,"Context: Charles Richter developed the Richter magnitude scale in 1935. The Richter scale measures the magnitude of an earthquakes largest jolt of energy. This is determined by using the height of the waves recorded on a seismograph. Richter scale magnitudes jump from one level to the next. The height of the largest wave increases 10 times with each level. So the height of the largest seismic wave of a magnitude 5 quake is 10 times that of a magnitude 4 quake. A magnitude 5 is 100 times that of a magnitude 3 quake. With each level, thirty times more energy is released. A difference of two levels on the Richter scale equals 900 times more released energy. The Richter scale has limitations. A single sharp jolt measures higher on the Richter scale than a very long intense earthquake. Yet this is misleading because the longer quake releases more energy. Earthquakes that release more energy are likely to do more damage. As a result, another scale was needed. 
Question: under what circumstances would the richter scale give a greater magnitude to a quake than the magnitude moment scale?
Options:(A) If there was more energy released (B) If there was more damage done (C) If the energy was released in jolts rather than a steady stream (D) If the quake had a single sharp jolt but otherwise did not release as much energy

Answer:",A
1005,"Context: Soil is a complex mixture of different materials. About half of most soils are inorganic materials, such as the products of weathered rock, including pebbles, sand, silt, and clay particles. About half of all soils are organic materials, formed from the partial breakdown and decomposition of plants and animals. The organic materials are necessary for a soil to be fertile. The organic portion provides the nutrients, such as nitrogen, needed for strong plant growth. In between the solid pieces, there are tiny spaces filled with air and water. Within the soil layer, important reactions between solid rock, liquid water, air, and living things take place. In some soils, the organic portion could be missing, as in desert sand. Or a soil could be completely organic, such as the materials that make up peat in a bog or swamp (Figure 1.1). 
Question: about half of the soil is made of organic material.

1010,"Context: Biological activity produces the organic material in soil. Humus forms from the remains of plants and animals. It is an extremely important part of the soil. Humus coats the mineral grains. It binds them together into clumps that hold the soil together. This gives the soil its structure. Soils with high humus are better able to hold water. Soils rich with organic materials hold nutrients better and are more fertile. These soils are more easily farmed. The color of soil indicates its fertility. Black or dark brown soils are rich in nitrogen and contain a high percentage of organic materials. Soils that are nitrogen poor and low in organic material might be gray, yellow, or red.

1012,"Context: The agents of soil erosion are the same as the agents of all types of erosion: water, wind, ice, or gravity. Running water is the leading cause of soil erosion, because water is abundant and has a lot of power. Wind is also a leading cause of soil erosion because wind can pick up soil and blow it far away. Activities that remove vegetation, disturb the ground, or allow the ground to dry are activities that increase erosion. What are some human activities that increase the likelihood that soil will be eroded? 
Question: which of the following natural phenomena can increase soil erosion?
Options:(A) A large reduction of rainfall (B) A large increase of rainfall (C) A forest fire (D) All of the above
Answer:",D
1013,"Context: Agriculture is probably the most significant activity that accelerates soil erosion because of the amount of land that is farmed and how much farming practices disturb the ground (Figure 1.1). Farmers remove native vegetation and then plow the land to plant new seeds. Because most crops grow only in spring and summer, the land lies fallow during the winter. Of course, winter is also the stormy season in many locations, so wind and rain are available to wash soil away. Tractor tires make deep grooves, which are natural pathways for water. Fine soil is blown away by wind. The soil that is most likely to erode is the nutrient-rich topsoil, which degrades the farmland. (a) The bare areas of farmland are especially vulnerable to erosion. (b) Slash-and-burn agriculture leaves land open for soil erosion and is one of the leading causes of soil erosion in the world. 
Question: which farming activities often increase soil erosion?
Options:(A) Plowing the land (B) Leaving land fallow (without plants (C) Disturbing the land with heavy machinery (D) All of the above
Answer:",D
1014,"Context: Grazing animals (Figure 1.2) wander over large areas of pasture or natural grasslands eating grasses and shrubs. Grazers expose soil by removing the plant cover for an area. They also churn up the ground with their hooves. If too many animals graze the same land area, the animals hooves pull plants out by their roots. A land is overgrazed if too many animals are living there. Grazing animals can cause erosion if they are allowed to overgraze and remove too much or all of the vegetation in a pasture. 
Question: how do grazing animals increase soil erosion?

1016,"Context: Logging removes trees that protect the ground from soil erosion. The tree roots hold the soil together and the tree canopy protects the soil from hard falling rain. Logging results in the loss of leaf litter, or dead leaves, bark, and branches on the forest floor. Leaf litter plays an important role in protecting forest soils from erosion (Figure 1.3). Logging exposes large areas of land to erosion. Much of the worlds original forests have been logged. Many of the tropical forests that remain are currently the site of logging because North America and Europe have already harvested many of their trees (Figure 1.4). Soils eroded from logged forests clog rivers and lakes, fill estuaries, and bury coral reefs. Surface mining disturbs the land (Figure 1.5) and leaves the soil vulnerable to erosion. 
Question: how do trees protect the ground from soil erosion?
Options:(A) Tree roots hold the soil together (B) A tree canopy stops the rain from falling so hard onto the ground (C) Leaf litter covers the ground and protects it (D) All of the above
Answer:",D
1017,"Context: Recreational activities may accelerate soil erosion. Off-road vehicles disturb the landscape and the area eventually develops bare spots where no plants can grow. In some delicate habitats, even hikers boots can disturb the ground, so its important to stay on the trail (Figure 1.7). Soil erosion is as natural as any other type of erosion, but human activities have greatly accelerated soil erosion. In some locations soil erosion may occur about 10 times faster than its natural rate. Since Europeans settled in North America, about one-third of the topsoil in the area that is now the United States has eroded away.

In some locations soil erosion may occur about 10 times faster than its natural rate. Since Europeans settled in North America, about one-third of the topsoil in the area that is now the United States has eroded away. Deforested swatches in Brazil show up as gray amid the bright red tropical rainfor- est. (a) Disturbed land at a coal mine pit in Germany.

Question: about one-tenth of the topsoil that was present in the united states before the arrival of europeans has now eroded away.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
1020,"Context: Bad farming practices and a return to normal rainfall levels after an unusually wet period led to the Dust Bowl. In some regions more than 75% of the topsoil blew away. This is the most extreme example of soil erosion the United States has ever seen. Still, in many areas of the world, the rate of soil erosion is many times greater than the rate at which it is forming. Drought, insect plagues, or outbreaks of disease are natural cycles of events that can negatively impact ecosystems and the soil, but there are also many ways in which humans neglect or abuse this important resource. Soils can also be contaminated if too much salt accumulates in the soil or where pollutants sink into the ground. One harmful practice is removing the vegetation that helps to hold soil in place. Sometimes just walking or riding your bike over the same place will kill the grass that normally grows there. Land is also deliberately cleared or deforested for wood. The loose soils then may be carried away by wind or running water. A farmer and his sons walk through a dust storm in Cimarron County, Oklahoma in 1936. Click image to the left or use the URL below.

Question: the loss of topsoil to erosion is bad because
Options:(A) Topsoil contains most of the nutrients (B) Topsoil protects the rich organic material beneath it (C) When the topsoil is gone it means that the entire soil profile has eroded away (D) All of the above
Answer:",A
1021,"Context: The agents of soil erosion are the same as the agents of all types of erosion: water, wind, ice, or gravity. Running water is the leading cause of soil erosion, because water is abundant and has a lot of power. Wind is also a leading cause of soil erosion because wind can pick up soil and blow it far away. Activities that remove vegetation, disturb the ground, or allow the ground to dry are activities that increase erosion. What are some human activities that increase the likelihood that soil will be eroded? 
Question: the agents of erosion are water, ice, wind and gravity.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",A
1022,"Context: Scientists know that climate is the most important factor determining soil type because, given enough time, different rock types in a given climate will produce a similar soil (Figure 1.1). Even the same rock type in different climates will not produce the same type of soil. This is true because most rocks on Earth are made of the same eight elements and when the rock breaks down to become soil, those elements dominate. The same factors that lead to increased weathering also lead to greater soil formation. More rain equals more chemical reactions to weather minerals and rocks. Those reactions are most efficient in the top layers of the soil, where the water is fresh and has not yet reacted with other materials. Increased rainfall increases the amount of rock that is dissolved as well as the amount of material that is carried away by moving water. As materials are carried away, new surfaces are exposed, which also increases the rate of weathering. Climate is the most important factor in determining the type of soil that will form in a particular area. Increased temperature increases the rate of chemical reactions, which also increases soil formation. In warmer regions, plants and bacteria grow faster, which helps to weather material and produce soils. In tropical regions, where temperature and precipitation are consistently high, thick soils form. Arid regions have thin soils. Soil type also influences the type of vegetation that can grow in the region. We can identify climate types by the types of plants that grow there. 
Question: what type of climate produces the thickest soils?
Options:(A) Continental (B) Arid (C) Tropical (D) Subarctic
Answer:",C
1023,"Context: The original rock is the source of the inorganic portion of the soil. The minerals that are present in the rock determine the composition of the material that is available to make soil. Soils may form in place or from material that has been moved. Residual soils form in place. The underlying rock breaks down to form the layers of soil that reside above it. Only about one-third of the soils in the United States are residual. Transported soils have been transported in from somewhere else. Sediments can be transported into an area by glaciers, wind, water, or gravity. Soils form from the loose particles that have been transported to a new location and deposited. 
Question: in the united states, residual soils are more common than transported soils.

1026,"Context: Biological activity produces the organic material in soil. Humus forms from the remains of plants and animals. It is an extremely important part of the soil. Humus coats the mineral grains. It binds them together into clumps that hold the soil together. This gives the soil its structure. Soils with high humus are better able to hold water. Soils rich with organic materials hold nutrients better and are more fertile. These soils are more easily farmed. The color of soil indicates its fertility. Black or dark brown soils are rich in nitrogen and contain a high percentage of organic materials. Soils that are nitrogen poor and low in organic material might be gray, yellow, or red.

Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",A
1028,"Context: The steeper the slope, the less likely material will be able to stay in place to form soil. Material on a steep slope is likely to go downhill. Materials will accumulate and soil will form where land areas are flat or gently undulating. 
Question: steep slopes tend to develop rich soils.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
1029,"Context: The partial decay of plant material and animal remains produces the organic material and nutrients in soil. In soil, decomposing organisms breakdown the complex organic molecules of plant matter and animal remains to form simpler inorganic molecules that are soluble in water. Decomposing organisms also create organic acids that increase the rate of weathering and soil formation. Bacteria in the soil change atmospheric nitrogen into nitrates. The decayed remains of plant and animal life are called humus, which is an extremely important part of the soil. Humus coats the mineral grains. It binds them together into clumps that then hold the soil together, creating its structure. Humus increases the soils porosity and water-holding capacity and helps to buffer rapid changes in soil acidity. Humus also helps the soil to hold its nutrients, increasing its fertility. Fertile soils are rich in nitrogen, contain a high percentage of organic materials, and are usually black or dark brown in color. Soils that are nitrogen poor and low in organic material might be gray or yellow or even red in color. Fertile soils are more easily cultivated. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:

Answer:",D
1032,"Context: Soil develops over time and forms soil horizons. Soil horizons are different layers of soil with depth. The most weathering occurs in the top layer. This layer is most exposed to weather! It is where fresh water comes into contact with the soil. Each layer lower is weathered just a little bit less than the layer above. As water moves down through the layers, it is able to do less work to change the soil. If you dig a deep hole in the ground, you may see each of the different layers of soil. All together, the layers are a soil profile. Each horizon has its own set of characteristics (Figure 9.8). In the simplest soil profile, a soil has three horizons.

Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",A
1034,"Context: Called the A-horizon, the topsoil is usually the darkest layer of the soil because it has the highest proportion of organic material. The topsoil is the region of most intense biological activity: insects, worms, and other animals burrow through it and plants stretch their roots down into it. Plant roots help to hold this layer of soil in place. In the topsoil, minerals may dissolve in the fresh water that moves through it to be carried to lower layers of the soil. Very small particles, such as clay, may also get carried to lower layers as water seeps down into the ground. 
Question: this layer of soil has the highest proportion of organic material.
Options:(A) Topsoil (B) Subsoil (C) C-horizon (D) Bedrock
Answer:",A
1035,"Context: The next layer down is the C horizon. This layer is made of partially altered bedrock. There is evidence of weathering in this layer. Still, it is possible to identify the original rock type from which this soil formed (Figure Not all climate regions develop soils. Arid regions are poor at soil development. Not all regions develop the same soil horizons. Some areas develop as many as five or six distinct layers. Others develop only a few.

1040,"Context: Rainwater absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2 ) as it falls. The CO2 combines with water to form carbonic acid. The slightly acidic water sinks into the ground and moves through pore spaces in soil and cracks and fractures in rock. The flow of water underground is groundwater. Groundwater is described further in the chapter Water on Earth. Groundwater is a strong erosional force, as it works to dissolve away solid rock (Figure 1.1). Carbonic acid is especially good at dissolving the rock limestone.

Answer:",C
1048,"Context: If you live in an earthquake zone, there are many things you can do to protect yourself. You must protect your home. Your household must be ready to live independently for a few days. It may take emergency services that long to get to everyone. Before an Earthquake: Make sure the floor, walls, roof, and foundation are all well attached to each other. Have an engineer evaluate your house for structural integrity. Bracket or brace brick chimneys to the roof. Be sure that heavy objects are not stored in high places. Move them to low places so that they do not fall. Secure water heaters all around and at the top and bottom. Bolt heavy furniture onto walls with bolts, screws, or strap hinges. Replace halogen and incandescent light bulbs with fluorescent bulbs to lessen fire risk. Check to see that gas lines are made of flexible material so they do not rupture. Any equipment that uses gas should be well secured. Everyone in the household should know how to shut off the gas line. A wrench should be placed nearby for doing so. Prepare an earthquake kit with at least three days supply of water and food. Include a radio and batteries. Place flashlights all over the house so there is always one available. Place one in the glove box of your car. Keep several fire extinguishers around the house to fight any small fires that break out. Be sure to have a first aid kit. Everyone in the household who is capable should know basic first aid and CPR. Plan in advance how you will evacuate your property and where you will go. Do not plan on driving, as roadways will likely be damaged. During the Earthquake: If you are in a building, drop to the ground, get beneath a sturdy table or desk, cover your head, and hold on. Stay away from windows and mirrors since glass can break and fall on you. Stay away from large furniture that may fall on you. If the building is structurally unsound, get outside as fast as possible. Run into an open area away from buildings and power lines that may fall on you. If you are in a car, stay in the car and stay away from structures that might collapse like overpasses, bridges, or buildings. After the Earthquake: Be aware that aftershocks are likely. Avoid dangerous areas, like hillsides, that may experience a landslide. Turn off water, gas lines, and power to your home. Use your phone only if there is an emergency.

1051,"Context: Trash from the lands all around the North Pacific is caught up in currents. The currents bring the trash into the center of the North Pacific Gyre. Scientists estimate that it takes about six years for trash to move from west coast of North America to the center of the gyre. The concentration of trash increases toward the center of the gyre. While recognizable pieces of garbage are visible, much of the trash is tiny plastic polymers that are invisible but can be detected in water samples. The particles are at or just below the surface within the gyre. Plastic confetti-like pieces are visible beneath the surface at the gyres center. This albatross likely died from the plastic it had ingested. The size of the garbage patch is unknown, since it cant be seen from above. Some people estimate that its twice the size of continental U.S, with a mass of 100 million tons.

1052,"Context: Ocean water moves in predictable ways along the ocean surface. Surface currents can flow for thousands of kilometers and can reach depths of hundreds of meters. These surface currents do not depend on weather; they remain unchanged even in large storms because they depend on factors that do not change. Surface currents are created by three things: global wind patterns the rotation of the Earth the shape of the ocean basins Surface currents are extremely important because they distribute heat around the planet and are a major factor influencing climate around the globe. 
Question: surface currents are a result of
Options:(A) Global wind patterns (B) Earth’s rotation (C) Shape of ocean basins (D) All of the above
Answer:",D
1053,"Context: The Coriolis effect describes how Earths rotation steers winds and surface ocean currents (Figure 1.1). Coriolis causes freely moving objects to appear to move to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. The objects themselves are actually moving straight, but the Earth is rotating beneath them, so they seem to bend or curve. Thats why it is incorrect to call Coriolis a force. It is not forcing anything to happen! An example might make the Coriolis effect easier to visualize. If an airplane flies 500 miles due north, it will not arrive at the city that was due north of it when it began its journey. Over the time it takes for the airplane to fly 500 miles, that city moved, along with the Earth it sits on. The airplane will therefore arrive at a city to the west of the original city (in the Northern Hemisphere), unless the pilot has compensated for the change. So to reach his intended destination, the pilot must also veer right while flying north. As wind or an ocean current moves, the Earth spins underneath it. As a result, an object moving north or south along the Earth will appear to move in a curve instead of in a straight line. Wind or water that travels toward the poles from the Equator is deflected to the east, while wind or water that travels toward the Equator from the poles gets bent to the west. The Coriolis effect bends the direction of surface currents to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and left in the Southern Hemisphere. The Coriolis effect causes winds and cur- rents to form circular patterns. The di- rection that they spin depends on the hemisphere that they are in. Coriolis effect is demonstrated using a metal ball and a rotating plate in this video. The ball moves in a circular path just like a freely moving particle of gas or liquid moves on the rotating Earth (5b). Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: 
Question: coriolis effect is
Options:(A) The apparent motion of freely moving objects as Earth rotates beneath them (B) The force of Earth’s rotation pushing on freely moving objects (C) What happens when freely moving objects (D) like air and water (E) meet high and low pressure cells (F) d None of these
Answer:",A
1054,"Context: Lets look at the global wind belts in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Hadley cell air should move north to south, but it is deflected to the right by Coriolis. So the air blows from northeast to the southwest. This belt is the trade winds, so called because at the time of sailing ships they were good for trade. In the Ferrel cell air should move south to north, but the winds actually blow from the southwest. This belt is the westerly winds or westerlies. In the Polar cell, the winds travel from the northeast and are called the polar easterlies. The wind belts are named for the directions from which the winds come. The westerly winds, for example, blow from west to east. These names hold for the winds in the wind belts of the Southern Hemisphere as well. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:

Answer:",C
1055,"Context: Global winds blow in belts encircling the planet. Notice that the locations of these wind belts correlate with the atmospheric circulation cells. Air blowing at the base of the circulation cells, from high pressure to low pressure, creates the global wind belts. The global wind belts are enormous and the winds are relatively steady (Figure 1.1). 
Question: wind in the global wind belts
Options:(A) Forms a gyre (B) like the surface ocean currents below it (C) b Blows around the planet (D) with alternating bands blowing in opposite directions (E) c Blow west to east around the planet (F) d Blow west to east in the Northern Hemisphere and east to west in the Southern Hemisphere
Answer:",B
1056,"Context: Winds and surface currents tend to move from the hot equator north or south toward the much cooler poles. Thats because of differences in the temperature of air masses over Earths surface. But Earth is spinning on its axis underneath the wind and water as they move. The Earth rotates from west to east. As a result, winds and currents actually end up moving toward the northeast or southeast. This effect of Earths rotation on the direction of winds and currents is called the Coriolis effect. 
Question: the northern hemisphere gyres rotate counter clockwise.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
1057,"Context: When a surface current collides with land, the current must change direction. In the Figure 1.1, the Atlantic South Equatorial Current travels westward along the Equator until it reaches South America. At Brazil, some of it goes north and some goes south. Because of Coriolis effect, the water goes right in the Northern Hemisphere and left in the Southern Hemisphere. 
Question: when a surface ocean current traveling from east to west across the ocean runs into a continent, it will turn __________ in the northern hemisphere and __________ in the southern hemisphere.
Options:(A) Left (B) left (C) b Left (D) right (E) c Right (F) left (G) d Right (H) right
Answer:",C
1058,"Context: The surface currents described above are all large and unchanging. Local surface currents are also found along shorelines (Figure 1.3). Two are longshore currents and rip currents. Rip currents are potentially dangerous currents that carry large amounts of water offshore quickly. Each summer in the United States at least a few people die when they are caught in rip currents. Longshore currents move water and sediment parallel to the shore in the direction of the prevailing local winds. 
Question: if you get caught in a rip current, what should you do?
Options:(A) Swim straight in to shore (B) Swim straight out from the shore and then back in (C) Ride the rip current until it carries you to shore (D) Swim parallel to the shore and then swim back in
Answer:",D
1059,"Context: Most waves strike the shore at an angle. This causes longshore drift. Longshore drift moves sediment along the shore. Sediment is moved up the beach by an incoming wave. The wave approaches at an angle to the shore. Water then moves straight offshore. The sediment moves straight down the beach with it. The sediment is again picked up by a wave that is coming in at an angle. This motion is show in Figure 10.15 and at the link below. 
Question: how does a water molecule move that is stuck in a longshore current?
Options:(A) It goes into shore at an angle and comes away from shore perpendicular to the beach (B) It goes into shore at an angle and comes away from shore at an angle (C) It goes into shore perpendicular to the beach and out from shore perpendicular to the beach (D) It moves straight along the shore
Answer:",A
1060,"Context: Temperature is a measure of how fast the atoms in a material are vibrating. High temperature particles vibrate faster than low temperature particles. Rapidly vibrating atoms smash together, which generates heat. As a material cools down, the atoms vibrate more slowly and collide less frequently. As a result, they emit less heat. What is the difference between heat and temperature? Temperature measures how fast a materials atoms are vibrating. Heat measures the materials total energy. 
Question: high temperature particles vibrate more slowly than low temperature particles.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
1061,"Context: The Table 1.1 compares the specific heat of four different substances. Metals such as iron have low specific heat. It doesnt take much energy to raise their temperature. Thats why a metal spoon heats up quickly when placed in a cup of hot coffee. Sand also has a relatively low specific heat. Water, on the other hand, has a very high specific heat. It takes a lot more energy to increase the temperature of water than sand. This explains why the sand on a beach gets hot while the water stays cool. Differences in the specific heat of water and land even affect climate. Substance iron sand wood Specific Heat (joules) 0.45 0.67 1.76 Q: Metal cooking pots and pans often have wooden handles. Can you explain why? A: Wood has a higher specific heat than metal, so it takes more energy to heat a wooden handle than a metal handle. As a result, a wooden handle would heat up more slowly and be less likely to burn your hand when you touch it. 
Question: which of the following has high temperature, but little heat?
Options:(A) A hot tub (B) A bonfire (C) A candle flame (D) A barrel full of molten lead
Answer:",C
1062,"Context: Did you ever notice that moving air cools you down when youre hot and sweaty? For example, if you sit in front of a fan, you feel cooler. Thats because moving air helps to evaporate the sweat on your skin. But why does the evaporation of sweat cool you down? When a liquid such as sweat evaporates, energetic particles on the surface of the liquid escape into the air. After these particles leave, the remaining liquid has less energy, so it is cooler. This is called evaporative cooling. Q: On a hot day, high humidity makes you feel even hotter. Can you explain why? A: Humidity is a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air. When humidity is high, sweat evaporates more slowly because there is already a lot of water vapor in the air. The slower evaporation rate reduces the potential for evaporative cooling. 
Question: evaporative cooling works to cool a house in a hot, dry area because
Options:(A) When water changes state from liquid to gas it absorbs heat (B) When water changes state from gas to liquid it releases heat (C) Heat is radiated outward when water runs over a mesh screen (D) Heat is absorbed when water runs over a mesh screen

1063,"Context: Specific heat is a measure of how much energy it takes to raise the temperature of a substance. It is the amount of energy (in joules) needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the substance by 1  C. Specific heat is a property that is specific to a given type of matter. Thats why its called specific. 
Question: the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of material by 1.0oc.
Options:(A) Latent heat (B) Specific heat (C) Radiant heat (D) Solar heat
Answer:",B
1064,"Context: If water gets hot enough, it starts to boil. Bubbles of water vapor form in boiling water. This happens as particles of liquid water gain enough energy to completely overcome the force of attraction between them and change to the gaseous state. The bubbles rise through the water and escape from the pot as steam. The process in which a liquid boils and changes to a gas is called vaporization. The temperature at which a liquid boils is its boiling point. The boiling point of water is 100C (212F). Other types of matter may have higher or lower boiling points. For example, the boiling point of table salt is 1413C. The boiling point of nitrogen is -196C. 
Question: a pot of boiling water will not get hotter than 100oc (212of). if more heat is added, the water will evaporate.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",A
1065,"Context: The word exothermic means releasing heat. Energy, often in the form of heat, is released as an exothermic reaction proceeds. This is illustrated in the Figure 1.1. The general equation for an exothermic reaction is: Reactants  Products + Energy If the energy produced in an exothermic reaction is released as heat, it results in a rise in temperature. As a result, the products are likely to be warmer than the reactants. Note: H represents the change in en- ergy. Q: You turn on the hot water faucet, and hot water pours out. How does the water get hot? Do you think that an exothermic reaction might be involved? A: A hot water heater increases the temperature of water in most homes. Many hot water heaters burn a fuel such as natural gas. The burning fuel causes the water to get hot because combustion is an exothermic reaction. 
Question: when energy is released by a material, it gets warmer.

Answer:",D
1067,"Context: Coastal areas have a milder climate than inland areas. They are warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer. Thats because land near an ocean is influenced by the temperature of the oceans. The temperature of ocean water is moderate and stable. Why? There are two major reasons: 1. Water is much slower to warm up and cool down than land. As a result, oceans never get as hot or as cold as land. 2. Water flows through all the worlds oceans. Warm water from the equator mixes with cold water from the poles. The mixing of warm and cold water makes the water temperature moderate. Even inland temperatures are milder because of oceans. Without oceans, there would be much bigger temperature swings all over Earth. Temperatures might plunge hundreds of degrees below freezing in the winter. In the summer, lakes and seas might boil! Life as we know it could not exist on Earth without the oceans. 
Question: why is the ocean so good at moderating temperature near the coast?
Options:(A) It has a low specific heat (B) It has to gain or lose a lot of energy to change its temperature (C) It has a low latent heat (D) A & B

Answer:",D
1074,"Context: During a thunderstorm, some parts of a thunderhead become negatively charged. Other parts become positively charged. The difference in charge creates lightning. Lightning is a huge release of electricity. Lightning can jump between oppositely charged parts of the same cloud, between one cloud and another, or between a cloud and the ground. You can see lightning in Figure 16.13. Lightning blasts the air with energy. The air heats and expands so quickly that it explodes. This creates the loud sound of thunder. Do you know why you always hear the boom of thunder after you see the flash of lightning? Its because light travels faster than sound. If you count the seconds between seeing lightning and hearing thunder, you can estimate how far away the lightning was. A lapse of 5 seconds is equal to about a mile.

Options:(A) Parts of two different clouds (B) Two clouds (C) Between a cloud and the ground (D) All of the above
Answer:",D
1075,"Context: The downdrafts cool the air at the base of the cloud, so the air is no longer warm enough to rise. As a result, convection shuts down. Without convection, water vapor does not condense, no latent heat is released, and the thunderhead runs out of energy. A thunderstorm usually ends only 15 to 30 minutes after it begins, but other thunderstorms may start in the same area. 
Question: a thunderstorm will end when
Options:(A) All the moisture has rained out of the cloud (B) All the electrical charge in the cloud has been neutralized (C) Downdrafts cool the base of the cloud and shut down convection (D) All of the above
Answer:",C
1076,"Context: With severe thunderstorms, the downdrafts are so intense that when they hit the ground, warm air from the ground is sent upward into the storm. The warm air gives the convection cells more energy. Rain and hail grow huge before gravity pulls them to Earth. Severe thunderstorms can last for hours and can cause a lot of damage because of high winds, flooding, intense hail, and tornadoes. 
Question: what causes a severe thunderstorm?
Options:(A) Intense downdrafts hit the ground and shoot warm air back up into the cloud (B) There is more moisture in the cloud so the storm can last longer (C) The electrical charge is more intense due to the squall line (D) All of the above

1081,"Context: Continental lithosphere is low in density and very thick. Continental lithosphere cannot subduct. So when two continental plates collide, they just smash together, just like if you put your hands on two sides of a sheet of paper and bring your hands together. The material has nowhere to go but up (Figure 6.23)! Earthquakes and metamorphic rocks result from the tremendous forces of the collision. But the crust is too thick for magma to get through, so there are no volcanoes.

1083,"Context: Transform faults on continents separate two massive plates of lithosphere. As they slide past each other, they may have massive earthquakes. The San Andreas Fault in California is perhaps the worlds most famous transform fault. Land on the west side is moving northward relative to land on the east side. This means that Los Angeles is moving northward relative to Palm Springs. The San Andreas Fault is famous because it is the site of many earthquakes, large and small. (Figure At the San Andreas Fault in California, the Pacific Plate is sliding northeast relative to the North American plate, which is moving southwest. At the northern end of the picture, the transform boundary turns into a subduction zone. Transform plate boundaries are also found in the oceans. They divide mid-ocean ridges into segments. In the diagram of western North America, the mid-ocean ridge up at the top, labeled the Juan de Fuca Ridge, is broken apart by a transform fault in the oceans. A careful look will show that different plates are found on each side of the ridge: the Juan de Fuca plate on the east side and the Pacific Plate on the west side. 
Question: as you move south, the san andreas fault turns into a subduction zone. that means the transform boundary turns into this boundary.
Options:(A) Convergent (B) Transform (C) Divergent (D) Strike-slip
Answer:",A
1084,"Context: Two plates may slide past each other in opposite directions. This is called a transform plate boundary. These plate boundaries experience massive earthquakes. The worlds best known transform fault is the San Andreas Fault in California (Figure 6.25). At this fault, the Pacific and North American plates grind past each other. Transform plate boundaries are most common as offsets along mid-ocean ridges. Transform plate boundaries are different from the other two types. At divergent plate boundaries, new oceanic crust is formed. At convergent boundaries, old oceanic crust is destroyed. But at transform plate boundaries, crust is not created or destroyed.

Answer:",D
1087,"Context: Pedocal soil forms where grasses and brush are common (Figure 9.11). The climate is drier, with less than 65 cm of rain per year. With less rain, there is less chemical weathering. There is less organic material and the soils are slightly less fertile. 
Question: this type of soil is formed in drier, temperate areas where grasslands and brush grow.
Options:(A) Laterite (B) Pedocal (C) Pedalfer (D) None of the above
Answer:",B
1088,"Context: A third important type of soil is laterite. Laterite forms in tropical areas. Temperatures are warm and rain falls every day (Figure 9.12). So much rain falls that chemical weathering is intense. All soluble minerals are washed from the soil. Plant nutrients get leached or carried away. There is practically no humus. Laterite soils are often red in color from the iron oxides. If laterites are exposed to the Sun, they bake as hard as a brick. 
Question: this type of soil forms in tropical rainforests.
Options:(A) Laterite (B) Pedocal (C) Pedalfer (D) All of the above
Answer:",A
1089,"Context: Pedocal soils form in drier, temperate areas where grasslands and brush are the usual types of vegetation (Figure chemical weathering and less water to dissolve away soluble minerals, so more soluble minerals are present and fewer clay minerals are produced. It is a drier region with less vegetation, so the soils have lower amounts of organic material and are less fertile. A pedocal is named for the calcite enriched layer that forms. Water begins to move down through the soil layers, but before it gets very far, it begins to evaporate. Soluble minerals, like calcium carbonate, concentrate in a layer that marks the lowest place that water was able to reach. This layer is called caliche.

Answer:",C
1090,"Context: Deciduous trees, the trees that lose their leaves each winter, need at least 65 cm of rain per year. These forests produce soils called pedalfers, which are common in many areas of the temperate, eastern part of the United States (Figure 1.2). The word pedalfer comes from some of the elements that are commonly found in the soil. The ""Al"" in pedalfer is the chemical symbol of the element aluminum, and the ""Fe"" in pedalfer is the chemical symbol for iron. Pedalfers are usually a very fertile, dark brown or black soil. Not surprisingly, they are rich in aluminum clays and iron oxides. Because a great deal of rainfall is common in this climate, most of the soluble minerals dissolve and are carried away, leaving the less soluble clays and iron oxides behind. A pedalfer is the dark, fertile type of soil that will form in a forested region. 
Question: pedalfer is very fertile and is dark brown or black soil.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",A
1091,"Context: In tropical rainforests where it rains literally every day, laterite soils form (Figure 1.4). In these hot, wet, tropical regions, intense chemical weathering strips the soils of their nutrients. There is practically no humus. All soluble minerals are removed from the soil and all plant nutrients are carried away. All that is left behind are the least soluble materials, like aluminum and iron oxides. These soils are often red in color from the iron oxides. Laterite soils bake as hard as a brick if they are exposed to the Sun. A laterite is the type of thick, nutrient-poor soil that forms in the rainforest. Many climate types have not been mentioned here. Each produces a distinctive soil type that forms in the particular circumstances found there. Where there is less weathering, soils are thinner but soluble minerals may be present. Where there is intense weathering, soils may be thick but nutrient-poor. Soil development takes a very long time, it may take hundreds or even thousands of years for a good fertile topsoil to form. Soil scientists estimate that in the very best soil-forming conditions, soil forms at a rate of about 1mm/year. In poor conditions, soil formation may take thousands of years!

1093,"Context: Soils thicken as the amount of time available for weathering increases. The longer the amount of time that soil remains in a particular area, the greater the degree of alteration. 
Question: where there is intense weathering, soils may be thick and nutrient-rich.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
1094,"Context: Scientists know that climate is the most important factor determining soil type because, given enough time, different rock types in a given climate will produce a similar soil (Figure 1.1). Even the same rock type in different climates will not produce the same type of soil. This is true because most rocks on Earth are made of the same eight elements and when the rock breaks down to become soil, those elements dominate. The same factors that lead to increased weathering also lead to greater soil formation. More rain equals more chemical reactions to weather minerals and rocks. Those reactions are most efficient in the top layers of the soil, where the water is fresh and has not yet reacted with other materials. Increased rainfall increases the amount of rock that is dissolved as well as the amount of material that is carried away by moving water. As materials are carried away, new surfaces are exposed, which also increases the rate of weathering. Climate is the most important factor in determining the type of soil that will form in a particular area. Increased temperature increases the rate of chemical reactions, which also increases soil formation. In warmer regions, plants and bacteria grow faster, which helps to weather material and produce soils. In tropical regions, where temperature and precipitation are consistently high, thick soils form. Arid regions have thin soils. Soil type also influences the type of vegetation that can grow in the region. We can identify climate types by the types of plants that grow there. 
Question: soil forms at roughly the same rate in all climate types.
Options:(A) True (B) False

Answer:",B
1096,"Context: Prior to the Mount St. Helens eruption in 1980, the Lassen Peak eruption on May 22, 1915, was the most recent Cascades eruption. A column of ash and gas shot 30,000 feet into the air. This triggered a high-speed pyroclastic flow, which melted snow and created a volcanic mudflow known as a lahar. Lassen Peak currently has geothermal activity and could erupt explosively again. Mt. Shasta, the other active volcano in California, erupts every 600 to 800 years. An eruption would most likely create a large pyroclastic flow, and probably a lahar. Of course, Mt. Shasta could explode and collapse like Mt. Mazama in Oregon (Figure 1.4). Crater Lake fills the caldera of the col- lapsed Mt. Mazama, which erupted with 42 times more power than Mount St. He- lens in 1980. The bathymetry of the lake shows volcanic features such as cinder cones.

Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
1097,"Context: Figure 8.14 shows Mt. Fuji, a classic example of a composite volcano. Composite volcanoes have broad bases and steep sides. These volcanoes usually have a large crater at the top. The crater was created during the volcanos last eruption. Composite volcanoes are also called stratovolcanoes. This is because they are formed by alternating layers (strata) of magma and ash (Figure 8.15). The magma that creates composite volcanoes tends to be thick. The steep sides form because the lava cannot flow too far from the vent. The thick magma may also create explosive eruptions. Ash and pyroclasts erupt into the air. Much of this material falls back down near the vent. This creates the steep sides of stratovolcanoes. Composite volcanoes are common along convergent plate boundaries. When a tectonic plate subducts, it melts. This creates the thick magma needed for these eruptions. The Pacific Ring of Fire is dotted by composite volcanoes. 
Question: which of these are characteristics of composite volcanoes?
Options:(A) Always have a pointy top (B) like a classic volcano (C) b Are not associated with cinder cones (D) c Eruptions often explosive (E) d All of the above
Answer:",C
1098,"Context: Eruptions can be explosive or non-explosive. Only rarely do gentle and explosive eruptions happen in the same volcano. 
Question: this determines both eruption type and volcano type.
Options:(A) Magma composition (B) Plate tectonic setting (C) Temperature of eruption (D) Pressure of eruption
Answer:",A
1099,"Context: Although most volcanoes are found at convergent or divergent plate boundaries, intraplate volcanoes may be found in the middle of a tectonic plate. These volcanoes rise at a hotspot above a mantle plume. Melting at a hotspot is due to pressure release as the plume rises through the mantle. Earth is home to about 50 known hotspots. Most of these are in the oceans because they are better able to penetrate oceanic lithosphere to create volcanoes. But there are some large ones in the continents. Yellowstone is a good example of a mantle plume erupting within a continent. 
Question: shield volcanoes are common at intraplate hot spots.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",A
1100,"Context: Shield volcanoes get their name from their shape. Although shield volcanoes are not steep, they may be very large. Shield volcanoes are common at spreading centers or intraplate hot spots (Figure 1.4). Hawaii has some spectacular shield volcanoes including Mauna Kea, which is the largest mountain on Earth from base to top. The mountain stands 33,500 ft high, about 4,000 feet greater than the tallest mountain above sea level, Mt. Everest. A cross section of a composite volcano reveals alternating layers of rock and ash: (1) magma chamber, (2) bedrock, (3) pipe, (4) ash layers, (5) lava layers, (6) lava flow, (7) vent, (8) lava, (9) ash cloud. Frequently there is a large crater at the top from the last eruption. Mauna Kea on the Big Island of Hawaii is a classic shield volcano.

Answer:",C
1102,"Context: Shield volcanoes look like a huge ancient warriors shield laid down. Figure 8.16 shows the Kilaeua Volcano. A shield volcano has a very wide base. It is much flatter on the top than a composite volcano. The lava that creates shield volcanoes is reltively thin. The thin lava spreads out. This builds a large, flat volcano layer by layer. Shield volcanoes are very large. For example, the Mauna Loa Volcano has a diameter of more than 112 kilometers (70 miles). The volcano forms a significant part of the island of Hawaii. The top of nearby Mauna Kea Volcano is more than ten kilometers (6 miles) from its base on the seafloor. Shield volcanoes often form along divergent plate boundaries. They also form at hot spots, like Hawaii. Shield volcano eruptions are non-explosive.

Answer:",A
1104,"Context: Cinder cones are the most common type of volcano. A cinder cone has a cone shape, but is much smaller than a composite volcano. Cinder cones rarely reach 300 meters in height, but they have steep sides. Cinder cones grow rapidly, usually from a single eruption cycle. These volcanoes usually flank shield or composite volcanoes. Many cinder cones are found in Hawaii. A lava fountain erupts from Puu Oo, a cinder cone on Kilauea. 
Question: cinder cones have a cone shape because

Shield volcanoes are common at spreading centers or intraplate hot spots (Figure 1.4). Hawaii has some spectacular shield volcanoes including Mauna Kea, which is the largest mountain on Earth from base to top. The mountain stands 33,500 ft high, about 4,000 feet greater than the tallest mountain above sea level, Mt. Everest. A cross section of a composite volcano reveals alternating layers of rock and ash: (1) magma chamber, (2) bedrock, (3) pipe, (4) ash layers, (5) lava layers, (6) lava flow, (7) vent, (8) lava, (9) ash cloud. Frequently there is a large crater at the top from the last eruption. Mauna Kea on the Big Island of Hawaii is a classic shield volcano. 
Question: mauna loa in hawaii is this type of volcano.
Options:(A) Cinder cone volcano (B) Composite volcano (C) Shield volcano (D) None of the above
Answer:",C
1107,"Context: Viscous lava flows slowly. If there is not enough magma or enough pressure to create an explosive eruption, the magma may form a lava dome. Because it is so thick, the lava does not flow far from the vent. (Figure 1.2). Lava flows often make mounds right in the middle of craters at the top of volcanoes, as seen in the Figure 1.3. A fissure eruption on Mauna Loa in Hawaii travels toward Mauna Kea on the Big Is- land. Lava domes are large, round landforms created by thick lava that does not travel far from the vent. Lava domes may form in the crater of composite volcanoes as at Mount St. He- lens. 
Question: large, round landforms created by thick lava that does not travel far from the vent:
Options:(A) Lava dome (B) Lava volcano (C) Lava plateau (D) Lava neck
Answer:",A
1108,"Context: How would you be able to tell hotspot volcanoes from island arc volcanoes? At island arcs, the volcanoes are all about the same age. By contrast, at hotspots the volcanoes are youngest at one end of the chain and oldest at the other. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:

1109,"Context: A lava plateau forms when large amounts of fluid lava flow over an extensive area (Figure 1.4). When the lava solidifies, it creates a large, flat surface of igneous rock. Layer upon layer of basalt have created the Columbia Plateau, which covers more than 161,000 square kilometers (63,000 square miles) in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. 
Question: large amounts of fluid lava flow that solidifies and creates a large, flat surfaces of rock.
Options:(A) Lava dome (B) Lava volcano (C) Lava plateau (D) Lava neck
Answer:",C
1110,"Context: A lava plateau is made of a large amount of fluid lava. The lava flows over a large area and cools. This creates a large, flat surface of igneous rock. Lava plateaus may be huge. The Columbia Plateau covers over 161,000 square kilometers (63,000 square miles). It makes up parts of the states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. Thin, fluid lava created the rock that makes up the entire ocean floor. This is from multiple eruptions from vents at the mid-ocean ridge. While not exactly a lava plateau, its interesting to think about so much lava!

1115,"Context: Scientists study a volcanos history to try to predict when it will next erupt. They want to know how long it has been since it last erupted. They also want to know the time span between its previous eruptions. Volcanoes can be active, dormant, or extinct (Figure 8.12). An active volcano may be currently erupting. Alter- natively, it may be showing signs that it will erupt in the near future. A dormant volcano no longer shows signs of activity. But it has erupted in recent history and will probably erupt again. An extinct volcano is one that has not erupted in recent history. Scientists think that it will probably not erupt again. Scientists watch both active and dormant volcanoes closely for signs that show they might erupt. 
Question: how can a dormant volcano become active?

Answer:",A
1117,"Context: A chain of volcanoes forms as an oceanic plate moves over a hot spot. This is how it happens. A volcano forms over the hotspot. Since the plate is moving, the volcano moves off of the hotspot. When the hotspot erupts again, a new volcano forms over it. This volcano is in line with the first. Over time, there is a line of volcanoes. The youngest is directly above the hot spot. The oldest is the furthest away (Figure 6.27). The Hawaii-Emperor chain of volcanoes formed over the Hawaiian Hotspot. The Hawaiian Islands formed most

Answer:",D
1118,"Context: Magma forms deep beneath the Earths surface. Rock melts below the surface under tremendous pressure and high temperatures. Molten rock flows like taffy or hot wax. Most magmas are formed at temperatures between 600o C and 1300o C (Figure 8.8). Magma collects in magma chambers beneath Earths surface. Magma chambers are located where the heat and pressure are great enough to melt rock. These locations are at divergent or convergent plate boundaries or at hotpots. The chemistry of a magma determines the type of igneous rock it forms. The chemistry also determines how the magma moves. Thicker magmas tend to stay below the surface or erupt explosively. When magma is fluid and runny, it often reaches the surface by flowing out in rivers of lava. 
Question: magma is created when
Options:(A) the temperature rises (B) pressure lowers (C) water is added (D) all of the above
Answer:",D
1119,"Context: Of all the volcanoes in the world, very few are erupting at any given time. Scientists question whether a volcano that is not erupting will ever erupt again and then describe it as active, dormant, or extinct. Active: currently erupting or showing signs of erupting soon.

Question: a dormant volcano may erupt again.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",A
1121,"Context: Viscous lava cannot travel far down the sides of the volcano before it solidifies, which creates the steep slopes of a composite volcano. In some eruptions the pressure builds up so much that the material explodes as ash and small rocks. The volcano is constructed layer by layer, as ash and lava solidify, one upon the other (Figure 1.3). The result is the classic cone shape of composite volcanoes. Mount St. Helens was a beautiful, classic, cone-shaped volcano. In May 1980 the volcano blew its top off in an explosive eruption, losing 1,300 feet off its summit. Mt. Fuji in Japan is one of the worlds most easily recognized composite volca- noes.

Answer:",A
1124,"Context: Earthquakes may take place every day near a volcano. But before an eruption the number and size of earthquakes increases. This is the result of magma pushing upward into the magma chamber. This motion causes stresses on neighboring rock to build up. Eventually the ground shakes. A continuous string of earthquakes may indicate that a volcano is about to erupt. Scientists use seismographs to record the length and strength of each earthquake. 
Question: what is the connection between the location of earthquakes and volcanoes?

Answer:",B
1125,"Context: A small amount of geologic activity, known as intraplate activity, does not take place at plate boundaries but within a plate instead. Mantle plumes are pipes of hot rock that rise through the mantle. The release of pressure causes melting near the surface to form a hotspot. Eruptions at the hotspot create a volcano. Hotspot volcanoes are found in a line (Figure 1.1). Can you figure out why? Hint: The youngest volcano sits above the hotspot and volcanoes become older with distance from the hotspot. 
Question: hotspot volcanoes are made by ________________.

1127,"Context: The first photo above is of a volcanic eruption in Hawaii. Hawaii is not in western North America, but is in the central Pacific ocean, near the middle of the Pacific Plate. The Hawaiian Islands are a beautiful example of a hotspot chain in the Pacific Ocean. Kilauea volcano lies above the Hawaiian hotspot. Mauna Loa volcano is older than Kilauea and is still erupting, but at a slower rate. The islands get progressively older to the northwest because they are further from the hotspot. This is because the Pacific Plate is moving toward the northwest over the hotspot. Loihi, the youngest volcano, is still below the sea surface. Since many hotspots are stationary in the mantle, geologists can use some hotspot chains to tell the direction and the speed a plate is moving (Figure 1.2). The Hawaiian chain continues into the Emperor Seamounts. The bend in the chain was caused by a change in the direction of the Pacific Plate 43 million years ago. Using the age and distance of the bend, geologists can figure out the speed of the Pacific Plate over the hotspot. The Hawaiian Islands have formed from volcanic eruptions above the Hawaii hotspot.

Question: hawaii is the only hotspot volcano chain in oceanic crust.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
1129,"Context: Hot spots are also found under the continental crust. Since it is more difficult for magma to make it through the thick crust, they are much less common. One exception is the Yellowstone hotspot (Figure 6.28). This hotspot is very active. In the past, the hotspot produced enormous volcanic eruptions. Now its activity is best seen in the regions famous geysers. 
Question: most hotspots are located beneath continental crust, like yellowstone.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",B
1130,"Context: The hotspots that are known beneath continents are extremely large. The reason is that it takes a massive mantle plume to generate enough heat to penetrate through the relatively thick continental crust. The eruptions that come from these hotspots are infrequent but massive, often felsic and explosive. All thats left at Yellowstone at the moment is a giant caldera and a very hot spot beneath. 
Question: eruptions of hotspots beneath continents are extremely explosive because

Answer:",C
1131,"Context: The South Pacific has many hotspot volcanic chains. The hotspot is beneath the youngest volcano in the chain and older volcanoes are found to the northwest. A volcano forms above the hotspot, but as the Pacific Plate moves, that volcano moves off the hotspot. Without its source of volcanism, it no longer erupts. The crust gets cooler and the volcano erodes. The result is a chain of volcanoes and seamounts trending northwest from the hotspot. Prominent hotspots of the world. (a) The Society Islands formed above a hotspot that is now beneath Mehetia and two submarine volcanoes. (b) The satellite image shows how the islands become smaller and coral reefs became more developed as the volcanoes move off the hotspot and grow older. The most famous example of a hotspot in the oceans is the Hawaiian Islands. Forming above the hotspot are massive shield volcanoes that together create the islands. The lavas are mafic and have low viscosity. These lavas produce beautiful ropy flows of pahoehoe and clinkery flows of aa, which will be described in more detail in Effusive Eruptions. 
Question: you know that a chain of volcanoes formed at a hotspot rather than due to subduction if

1135,"Context: Volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries are found all along the Pacific Ocean basin, primarily at the edges of the Pacific, Cocos, and Nazca plates. Trenches mark subduction zones, although only the Aleutian Trench and the Java Trench appear on the map in the previous concept, ""Volcano Characteristics."" The Cascades are a chain of volcanoes at a convergent boundary where an oceanic plate is subducting beneath a continental plate. Specifically the volcanoes are the result of subduction of the Juan de Fuca, Gorda, and Explorer Plates beneath North America. The volcanoes are located just above where the subducting plate is at the right depth in the mantle for there to be melting (Figure 1.1). The Cascades have been active for 27 million years, although the current peaks are no more than 2 million years old. The volcanoes are far enough north and are in a region where storms are common, so many are covered by glaciers. 
Question: volcanoes erupt at this type of convergent plate boundary.
Options:(A) Ocean-ocean (B) Ocean-continental (C) Continental-continental (D) Both a and b
Answer:",D
1136,"Context: Converging plates can be oceanic, continental, or one of each. If both are continental they will smash together and form a mountain range. If at least one is oceanic, it will subduct. A subducting plate creates volcanoes. In the chapter Plate Tectonics we moved up western North America to visit the different types of plate boundaries there. Locations with converging in which at least one plate is oceanic at the boundary have volcanoes. 
Question: when two oceanic plates converge, it produces these types of volcanoes.
Options:(A) Hot spot volcanoes (B) Continental arc volcanoes (C) Mid-ocean ridge volcanoes (D) Island arc volcanoes
Answer:",D
1137,"Context: Iceland provides us with a fabulous view of a mid-ocean ridge above sea level (Figure 1.1) As you can see, where plates diverge at a mid-ocean ridge is a rift valley that marks the boundary between the two plates. Basalt lava erupts into that rift valley and forms new seafloor. Seafloor on one side of the rift is part of one plate and seafloor on the other side is part of another plate. Leif the Lucky Bridge straddles the divergent plate boundary. Look back at the photo at the top. You may think that the rock on the left side of the valley looks pretty much like the rock on the right side. Thats true - its all basalt and it even all has the same magnetic polarity. The rocks on both sides are extremely young. Whats different is that the rock one side of the bridge is the youngest rock of the North American Plate while the rock on the other side is the youngest rock on the Eurasian plate. This is a block diagram of a divergent plate boundary. Remember that most of these are on the seafloor and only in Iceland do we get such a good view of a divergent plate boundary in the ocean. 
Question: iceland is part of the mid-ocean ridge.
Options:(A) True (B) False
Answer:",A
1138,"Context: At divergent plate boundaries hot mantle rock rises into the space where the plates are moving apart. As the hot mantle rock convects upward it rises higher in the mantle. The rock is under lower pressure; this lowers the melting temperature of the rock and so it melts. Lava erupts through long cracks in the ground, or fissures. 
Question: by what process do plates return back into the mantle, ultimately to make magma for volcanoes?
Options:(A) Sea-floor spreading (B) Transform motion (C) Subduction (D) Hotspots
Answer:",C
1139,"Context: Eruptions are found at divergent plate boundaries as continents break apart. The volcanoes in Figure 1.4 are in the East African Rift between the African and Arabian plates.

Answer:",D
1142,"Context: Two oceanic plates may collide. In this case, the older plate is denser. This plate subducts beneath the younger plate. As the subducting plate is pushed deeper into the mantle, it melts. The magma this creates rises and erupts. This forms a line of volcanoes, known as an island arc (Figure 6.21). Japan, Indonesia, the Philippine Islands, and the Aleutian Islands of Alaska are examples of island arcs (Figure 6.22). 
Question: during subduction the plate that goes under is

1148,"Context: Sponges reproduce both asexually and sexually. Asexual reproduction occurs by budding. Sexual reproduction occurs by the production of eggs and sperm. Males release sperm into the water through the osculum. Sperm may enter a female sponge through a pore and fertilize her eggs. The resulting zygotes develop into larvae. Unlike sponge adults, sponge larvae can swim. They have cilia that propel them through the water. As larvae develop and grow, they become more similar to an adult sponge and lose their ability to swim. 
Question: Which statement about reproduction in sponges is false?

Answer:",C
1149,"Context: Sponges have several different types of specialized cells, although they lack tissues. You can see the basic sponge body plan and specialized cells in Figure 12.4. Some of the specialized cells grow short, sharp projections called spicules. Spicules make up the sponges internal skeleton, or endoskeleton. The endoskeleton helps to support and protect the sponge. Other specialized cells are involved in feeding. Sponges are filter feeders. They filter food out of the water as it flows through them. Sponges pump water into their body through specialized pore cells called porocytes. The water flows through a large central cavity. As it flows by, specialized cells called collar cells trap and digest food particles in the water. Specialized cells called amebocytes carry nutrients from the digested food to the rest of the cells in the sponge. As water flows through the sponge, oxygen diffuses from the water to the sponges cells. The cells also expel wastes into the water. The water then flows out of the sponge through an opening called the osculum.

Options:(A) has a tubular body (B) can swim freely (C) reproduces sexually (D) always changes into a medusa
Answer:",A
1155,"Context: Some types of cnidarians are also known to form colonies. Two examples are described below. 1. The Portuguese Man o War ( Figure 1.1) looks like a single organism but is actually a colony of polyps. One polyp is filled with air to help the colony float, while several feeding polyps hang below with tentacles. The tentacles are full of nematocysts. The Portuguese Man o War is known to cause extremely painful stings to swimmers and surfers who accidentally brush up against it in the water. 2. Coral reefs ( Figure below) look like big rocks, but they are actually alive. They are built from cnidarians called corals. The corals are sessile (non-moving) polyps that can use their tentacles to feed on ocean creatures that pass by. Their skeletons are made up of calcium carbonate, which is also known as limestone. Over long periods of time, their skeletons build on each other to produce large structures known as coral reefs. Coral reefs are important habitats for many different types of ocean life. Corals are colonial cnidarians.

1160,"Context: Feeding strategies vary greatly among the different groups of echinoderms. Theres no one food or technique thats shared by all echinoderms. Different eating-methods include: 1. Passive filter-feeders, which are organisms that absorb suspended nutrients from passing water. Some echino- derms use their long arms to capture food particles floating past in the currents. 2. Grazers, such as sea urchins, are organisms that feed on available plants. Sea urchins are omnivorous, eating both plant and animals. The sea urchin mainly feeds on algae on the coral and rocks, along with decomposing matter such as dead fish, mussels, sponges, and barnacles. 3. Deposit feeders, which are organisms that feed on small pieces of organic matter, usually in the top layer of soil. Sea cucumbers are deposit feeders, living on the ocean floor. They eat the tiny scrap particles that are usually abundant in the environments that they inhabit. 4. Active hunters, which are organisms that actively hunt their prey. Many sea stars are predators, feeding on mollusks like clams by prying apart their shells and actually placing their stomach inside the mollusk shell to digest the meat.

Answer:",A
1168,"Context: Cnidarians can be found in almost all ocean habitats. A few species live in fresh water. Jellyfish spend most of their lives as medusae. They live virtually everywhere in the ocean. They prey on zooplankton, other invertebrates, and the eggs and larvae of fish. Corals form large colonies in shallow tropical water. They are confined to shallow water because they have a symbiotic relationship with algae that live inside of them. The algae need sunlight for photosynthesis, so they must stay relatively close to the surface of the water to get enough light. Corals exist only as polyps. They catch plankton with their tentacles. Many corals form a hard, mineral exoskeleton. Over time, this builds up to become a coral reef. A coral reef is pictured in Figure 12.10. Coral reefs provide food and shelter to many other ocean organisms.

1180,"Context: Cells are the basic building blocks of life. They are like tiny factories where virtually all life processes take place. Some living things, like the bacteria in Figure 2.1, consist of just one cell. They are called single-celled organisms. You can see other single-celled organisms in Figure 2.2. Some living things are composed of a few to many trillions of cells. They are called multicellular organisms. Your body is composed of trillions of cells. Regardless of the type of organism, all living cells share certain basic structures. For example, all cells are enclosed by a membrane. The cell membrane separates the cell from its environment. It also controls what enters or leaves the cell. 
Question: __Cells are the basic units of structure and function of all living things.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
1181,"Context: According to the cell theory, all organisms are made up of one or more cells. Cells are the sites where all life processes take place. Cells come only from pre-existing cells. New cells forms when existing cells divide. Most cells are too small to see without a microscope. If you were to look at a drop of your blood under a microscope, Figure 1.5 shows two types of cells you might see.

Some organisms reproduce asexually ( asexual reproduction), especially single-celled organisms, and make identical copies (or clones) of themselves. Other organisms reproduce sexually ( sexual reproduction), combining genetic information from two parents to make genetically unique offspring. 
Question: __All organisms must mate to produce offspring.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
1183,"Context: Recall that producers make their own food through photosynthesis. But many organisms are not producers and cannot make their own food. So how do these organisms obtain their energy? They must get their energy from other organisms. They must eat other organisms, or obtain their energy from these organisms some other way. The organisms that obtain their energy from other organisms are called consumers. All animals are consumers, and they eat other organisms. Fungi and many protists and bacteria are also consumers. But, whereas animals eat other organisms, fungi, protists, and bacteria ""consume"" organisms through different methods. The consumers can be placed into different groups, depending on what they consume. Herbivores are animals that eat producers to get energy. For example, rabbits and deer are herbivores that eat plants. The caterpillar pictured below ( Figure 1.1) is a herbivore. Animals that eat phytoplankton in aquatic environments are also herbivores. Carnivores feed on animals, either herbivores or other carnivores. Snakes that eat mice are carnivores. Hawks that eat snakes are also carnivores ( Figure 1.1). Omnivores eat both producers and consumers. Most people are omnivores, since they eat fruits, vegetables, and grains from plants, and also meat and dairy products from animals. Dogs, bears, and raccoons are also omnivores. Examples of consumers are caterpillars (herbivores) and hawks (carnivore). 
Question: _________organism that eats other organisms for food

1184,"Context: When you are cold, what does your body do to keep warm? You shiver to warm up your body. When you are too warm, you sweat to release heat. When any living organism gets thrown off balance, its body or cells help it return to normal. In other words, living organisms have the ability to keep a stable internal environment. Maintaining a balance inside the body or cells of organisms is known as homeostasis. Like us, many animals have evolved behaviors that control their internal temperature. A lizard may stretch out on a sunny rock to increase its internal temperature, and a bird may fluff its feathers to stay warm ( Figure 1.5). A bird fluffs its feathers to stay warm and to maintain homeostasis.

1185,"Context: When a living thing responds to its environment, it is responding to a stimulus. A stimulus (stimuli, plural) is something in the environment that causes a reaction in an organism. The reaction a stimulus produces is called a response. Imagine how you would respond to the following stimuli: Youre about to cross a street when the walk light turns red. You hear a smoke alarm go off in the kitchen. You step on an upturned tack with a bare foot. You smell the aroma of your favorite food. You taste something really sour. It doesnt take much imagination to realize that responding appropriately to such stimuli might help keep you safe. It might even help you survive.

There are two ways of producing food energy: Photosynthesis: plants on land, phytoplankton in the surface ocean, and some other organisms. Chemosynthesis: bacteria at hydrothermal vents. Organisms that use the food energy that was created by producers are named consumers. There are many types of consumers: Herbivores eat producers directly. These animals break down the plant structures to get the materials and energy they need. Carnivores eat animals; they can eat herbivores or other carnivores. Omnivores eat plants and animals as well as fungi, bacteria, and organisms from the other kingdoms.

His microscopes could magnify objects as much as 270 times their actual size. Van Leeuwenhoek made many scientific discoveries using his microscopes. He was the first to see and describe bacteria. He observed them in a sample of plaque that he had scraped off his own teeth. He also saw yeast cells, human sperm cells, and the microscopic life teeming in a drop of pond water. He even saw blood cells circulating in tiny blood vessels called capillaries. The drawings in Figure 1.12 show some of tiny organisms and living cells that van Leeuwenhoek viewed with his microscopes. He called them animalcules. 
Question: Microscopic organisms include
Options:(A) bacteria (B) archaea (C) protists (D) all of the above

1192,"Context: How do you define a living thing? What do mushrooms, daisies, cats, and bacteria have in common? All of these are living things, or organisms. It might seem hard to think of similarities among such different organisms, but they actually have many properties in common. Living organisms are similar to each other because all organisms evolved from the same common ancestor that lived billions of years ago. All living organisms: 1. Need energy to carry out life processes. 2. Are composed of one or more cells. 3. Respond to their environment. 4. Grow and reproduce. 5. Maintain a stable internal environment.

1193,"Context: The average human adult consists of an incredible 100 trillion cells! Cells are the basic units of structure and function in the human body, as they are in all living things. Each cell must carry out basic life processes in order to survive and help keep the body alive. Most human cells also have characteristics for carrying out other, special functions. For example, muscle cells have extra mitochondria to provide the energy needed to move the body. You can see examples of these and some other specialized human cells in Figure 16.1.

1194,"Context: Producers are living things that use energy to make food. Producers make food for themselves and other living things. There are two types of producers: By far the most common producers use the energy in sunlight to make food. This is called photosynthesis. Producers that photosynthesize include plants and algae. These organisms must live where there is plenty of sunlight. Which living things are producers in Figure 18.3? Other producers use the energy in chemicals to make food. This is called chemosynthesis. Only a very few producers are of this type, and all of them are microbes. These producers live deep under the ocean where there is no sunlight. You can see an example in Figure 18.4.

1195,"Context: All of the cells in the domain Eukarya keep their genetic material, or DNA, inside the nucleus. The domain Eukarya is made up of four kingdoms: 1. Plantae: Plants, such as trees and grasses, survive by capturing energy from the sun, a process called photo- synthesis. 2. Fungi: Fungi, such as mushrooms and molds, survive by ""eating"" other organisms or the remains of other organisms. These organisms absorb their nutrients from other organisms. 3. Animalia: Animals also survive by eating other organisms or the remains of other organisms. Animals range from tiny ants to the largest whales, and include arthropods, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals ( Figure 4. Protista: Protists are not all descended from a single common ancestor in the way that plants, animals, and fungi are. Protists are all the eukaryotic organisms that do not fit into one of the other three kingdoms. They include many kinds of microscopic one-celled (unicellular) organisms, such as algae and plankton, but also giant seaweeds that can grow to be 200 feet long. Plants, animals, fungi, and protists might seem very different, but remember that if you look through a microscope, you will find similar cells with a membrane-bound nucleus in all of them. These are eukaryotic cells. These cells also have membrane-bound organelles, which prokaryotic cells lack. The main characteristics of the three domains of life are summarized in Table 1.1.

1196,"Context: During sexual reproduction, two parents are involved. Most animals are dioecious, meaning there is a separate male and female sex, with the male producing sperm and the female producing eggs. When a sperm and egg meet during fertilization, a zygote, the first cell of a new organism, is formed ( Figure 1.2). This process combines the genetic material from both parents. The resulting organism will be genetically unique. The zygote will divide by mitosis and grow into the embryo. Lets explore how animals, plants, and fungi reproduce sexually: Animals often have gonads, organs that produce eggs or sperm. The male gonads are the testes, and the female gonads are the ovaries. Testes produce sperm; ovaries produce eggs. Sperm and egg, the two sex cells, are known as gametes, and can combine two different ways, both of which combine the genetic material from the two parents. Gametes have half the amount of the genetic material of a regular body cell; they are haploid cells. In humans, gametes have one set of 23 chromosomes. Gametes are produced through a special type of cell division known as meiosis. Normal human cells have 46 chromosomes. They are diploid cells, with two sets of 23 chromosomes (23 pairs). Bacteria reproduce by binary fission. Shown is one bacterium reproducing and becoming two bacteria. During sexual reproduction, a sperm fer- tilizes an egg. Fish and other aquatic animals release their gametes in the water, which is called external fertilization ( Figure by internal fertilization. Typically males have a penis that deposits sperm into the vagina of the female. Birds do not have penises, but they do have a chamber called the cloaca that they place close to another birds cloaca to deposit sperm. Amphibians must live close to water as they must lay their eggs in a moist or wet environment prior to external fertilization. This fish guards her eggs, which will be fertilized externally. Plants can also reproduce sexually, but their reproductive organs are different from animals gonads. Plants that have flowers have their reproductive parts in the flower. The sperm is contained in the pollen, while the egg is contained in the ovary, deep within the flower. The sperm can reach the egg two different ways: 1. In self-pollination, the egg is fertilized by the pollen of the same flower. 2. In cross-pollination, sperm from the pollen of one flower fertilizes the egg of another flower. Like other types of sexual reproduction, cross-pollination allows new combinations of traits. Cross-pollination occurs when pollen is carried by the wind to another flower. It can also occur when animal pollinators, like honeybees or butterflies ( Figure 1.4), carry the pollen from flower to flower. Butterflies receive nectar when they de- posit pollen into flowers, resulting in cross-pollination. 
Question: Which statement is true about sexual reproduction?
Options:(A) It involves just one parent (B) Offspring are identical to the parent (C) Offspring of both sexes are always produced (D) none of the above
Answer:",D
1197,"Context: People have been concerned with classifying organisms for thousands of years. Over 2,000 years ago, the Greek philosopher Aristotle developed a classification system that divided living things into several groups that we still use today, including mammals, insects, and reptiles. Carolus (Carl) Linnaeus (1707-1778) ( Figure 1.1) built on Aristotles work to create his own classification system. He invented the way we name organisms today, with each organism having a two word name. Linnaeus is considered the inventor of modern taxonomy, the science of naming and grouping organisms. In the 18th century, Carl Linnaeus invented the two-name system of naming organisms (genus and species) and introduced the most complete classification system then known. Linnaeus developed binomial nomenclature, a way to give a scientific name to every organism. In this system, each organism receives a two-part name in which the first word is the genus (a group of species), and the second word refers to one species in that genus. For example, a coyotes species name is Canis latrans. Latrans is the species and Canis is the genus, a larger group that includes dogs, wolves, and other dog-like animals. Here is another example: the red maple, Acer rubra, and the sugar maple, Acer saccharum, are both in the same genus and they look similar ( Figure 1.2). Notice that the genus is capitalized and the species is not, and that the whole scientific name is in italics. Tigers (Panthera tigris) and lions (Panthera leo) have the same genus name, but are obviously different species. The names may seem strange, but the names are written in a language called Latin. These leaves are from two different species of trees in the Acer, or maple, genus. The green leaf (far left) is from the sugar maple, and the red leaf (center ) are from the red maple. One of the character- istics of the maple genus is winged seeds (far right).

1200,"Context: You can see the main categories, or taxa (taxon, singular), of the Linnaean system in Figure 2.16. As an example, the figure applies the Linnaean system to classify our own species, Homo sapiens. Although the Linnaean system has been revised, it forms the basis of modern classification systems. The broadest category in the Linnaean system is the kingdom. Figure 2.16 shows the Animal Kingdom because Homo sapiens belongs to that kingdom. Other kingdoms include the Plant Kingdom, Fungus Kingdom, and Protist Kingdom. Kingdoms are divided, in turn, into phyla (phylum, singular). Each phylum is divided into classes, each class into orders, each order into families, and each family into genera (genus, singular). Each genus is divided into one or more species.

1203,"Context: This question was posed at the beginning of the chapter. Should viruses be placed in one of the three domains of life? Are viruses living things? Before considering these questions, you need to know the characteristics of viruses. A virus is nothing more than some DNA or RNA surrounded by a coat of proteins. A virus is not a cell. A virus cannot use energy, respond to stimuli, grow, or maintain homeostasis. A virus cannot reproduce on its own. However, a virus can reproduce by infecting the cell of a living host. Inside the host cell, the virus uses the cells structures, materials, and energy to make copies of itself. Because they have genetic material and can reproduce, viruses can evolve. Their DNA or RNA can change through time. The ability to evolve is a very lifelike attribute. Many scientists think that viruses should not be classified as living things because they lack most of the defining traits of living things. Other scientists arent so sure. They think that the ability of viruses to evolve and interact with living cells earns them special consideration. Perhaps a new category of life should be created for viruses. What do you think? 
Question: _________All scientists agree that viruses should be considered living things.

1210,"Context: Linnaeus is also famous for his method of naming species, which is still used today. The method is called binomial nomenclature. Every species is given a unique two-word name. Usually written in Latin, it includes the genus name followed by the species name. Both names are always written in italics, and the genus name is always capitalized. For example, the human species is named Homo sapiens. The species of the family dog is named Canis familiaris. Coming up with a scientific naming method may not seem like a big deal, but it really is. Prior to Linnaeus, there was no consistent way to name species. Names given to organisms by scientists were long and cumbersome. Often, different scientists came up with different names for the same species. Common names also differed, generally from one place to another. A single, short scientific name for each species avoided a lot of mistakes and confusion.

1215,"Context: The answer is actually no. A virus is essentially DNA or RNA surrounded by a coat of protein ( Figure 1.1). It is not made of a cell, and cannot maintain a stable internal environment ( homeostasis). Recall that a cell is the basic unit of living organisms. So if a virus is not made of at least one cell, can it be living? Viruses also cannot reproduce on their ownthey need to infect a host cell to reproduce. So a virus is very different from any of the organisms that fall into the three domains of life. Though viruses are not considered living, they share two important traits with living organisms. They have genetic material like all cells do (though they are not made of cells), and they can evolve. The genetic material of a virus can change (mutate), altering the traits of the virus. As the process of evolution has resulted in all life on the planet today, the classification of viruses has been controversial. It calls into question the very definition of life.

Answer:",D
1219,"Context: The skin is a very important barrier to pathogens. It is the bodys largest organ and the most important defense against disease. It forms a physical barrier between the body and the outside environment. The outer layer of the skin, called the epidermis, consists of dead cells filled with the protein keratin. These cells form a tough, waterproof covering on the body. It is very difficult for pathogens to get through the epidermis. The inside of the mouth and nose are lined with mucous membranes. Other organs that are exposed to substances from the environment are also lined with mucous membranes. These include the respiratory and digestive organs. Mucous membranes arent tough like skin, but they have other ways of keeping out pathogens. One way mucous membranes protect the body is by producing mucus. Mucus is a sticky, moist secretion that covers mucous membranes. The mucus traps pathogens and particles so they cant enter the body. Many mucous membranes are also covered with cilia. These are tiny, hair-like projections. Cilia move in waves and sweep mucus and trapped pathogens toward body openings. You can see this in the diagram in Figure 21.10. When you clear your throat or blow your nose, you remove mucus and pathogens from your body.

1222,"Context: Most body fluids that you release from your body contain chemicals that kill pathogens. For example, mucus, sweat, tears, and saliva contain enzymes called lysozymes that kill pathogens. These enzymes can break down the cell walls of bacteria to kill them. The stomach also releases a very strong acid, called hydrochloric acid. This acid kills most pathogens that enter the stomach in food or water. Urine is also acidic, so few pathogens can grow in it.

1225,"Context: If bacteria enter the skin through a splinter or other wound, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. It occurs due to chemicals that are released when tissue is damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, increasing blood flow to the area. The chemicals also attract white blood cells to the area. The white blood cells leak out of the blood vessels and into the damaged tissue. You can see an animation of the inflammatory response by watching this video: MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: 
Question: What causes inflammation in damaged tissue?
Options:(A) chemicals released when tissue is damaged (B) constriction of blood vessels near damaged tissue (C) development of a fever in damaged tissue (D) phagocytosis of damaged tissue
Answer:",A
1226,"Context: Phagocytes also release chemicals that cause a fever. A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6 F (37 C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce quickly at this temperature. When the temperature rises higher, the pathogens cant reproduce as quickly. Therefore, a fever helps to limit the infection. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells to fight the infection. 
Question: You develop a fever because of chemicals released by phagocytes.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
1227,"Context: What do these white blood cells do at the site of inflammation? The main role of white blood cells is to fight pathogens in the body. There are actually several different kinds of white blood cells. Some white blood cells have very specific functions. They attack only certain pathogens. Other white blood cells attack any pathogen they find. These white blood cells travel to areas of the body that are inflamed. They are called phagocytes, which means eating cells. Neutrophils are a type of phagocyte. In addition to pathogens, phagocytes eat dead cells. They surround the pathogens and destroy them. Sometimes it is said that the phagocyte engulfs the pathogen, and then destroys it. This process is called phagocytosis. White blood cells also make chemicals that cause a fever. A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6 F (37 C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells. In these ways, a fever helps the body fight infection. 
Question: How do phagocytes help fight an infection?
Options:(A) They engulf and destroy pathogens (B) They release chemicals that cause a fever (C) They are a physical barrier to pathogens (D) two of the above

1228,"Context: The skin is a very important barrier to pathogens. It is the bodys largest organ and the most important defense against disease. It forms a physical barrier between the body and the outside environment. The outer layer of the skin, called the epidermis, consists of dead cells filled with the protein keratin. These cells form a tough, waterproof covering on the body. It is very difficult for pathogens to get through the epidermis. The inside of the mouth and nose are lined with mucous membranes. Other organs that are exposed to substances from the environment are also lined with mucous membranes. These include the respiratory and digestive organs. Mucous membranes arent tough like skin, but they have other ways of keeping out pathogens. One way mucous membranes protect the body is by producing mucus. Mucus is a sticky, moist secretion that covers mucous membranes. The mucus traps pathogens and particles so they cant enter the body. Many mucous membranes are also covered with cilia. These are tiny, hair-like projections. Cilia move in waves and sweep mucus and trapped pathogens toward body openings. You can see this in the diagram in Figure 21.10. When you clear your throat or blow your nose, you remove mucus and pathogens from your body.

1229,"Context: If bacteria enter the skin through a splinter or other wound, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. It occurs due to chemicals that are released when tissue is damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, increasing blood flow to the area. The chemicals also attract white blood cells to the area. The white blood cells leak out of the blood vessels and into the damaged tissue.

1252,"Context: Lymph vessels make up a circulatory system that is similar to the blood vessels of the cardiovascular system. However, lymph vessels circulate lymph instead of blood, and the heart does not pump lymph through the vessels. Lymph that collects in tissues slowly passes into tiny lymph vessels. Lymph then travels from smaller to larger lymph vessels. Muscles around the lymph vessels contract and squeeze the lymph through the vessels. The lymph vessels also contract to help move the lymph along. Eventually, lymph reaches the main lymph vessels, which are located in the chest. From these vessels, lymph drains into two large veins of the cardiovascular system. This is how lymph returns to the blood. Before lymph reaches the bloodstream, it passes through small oval structures called lymph nodes, which are located along the lymph vessels.

There are two main types of lymphocytes: 1. B cells. This image of a lymphocyte was made with an electron microscope. The lym- phocyte is shown 10,000 times its actual size. 2. T cells. Both types of lymphocytes are produced in the red bone marrow. They are named for the sites where they grow larger. The ""B"" in B cells stands for bone. B cells grow larger in red bone marrow. The ""T"" in T cells stands for thymus. T cells mature in the thymus gland. B and T cells must be switched on in order to fight a specific pathogen. Once this happens, they produce an army of cells ready to fight that particular pathogen. How can B and T cells recognize specific pathogens? Pathogens have proteins, often located on their cell surface. These proteins are called antigens. An antigen is any protein that causes an immune response, because it is unlike any protein that the body makes. Antigens are found on bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens.

1254,"Context: Lymph vessels make up a circulatory system that is similar to the cardiovascular system, which you can read about in a previous concept. Lymph vessels are like blood vessels, except they move lymph instead of blood. Lymph is a yellowish liquid that leaks out of tiny blood vessels into spaces between cells in tissues. Where there is more inflammation, there is usually more lymph in tissues. This lymph may contain many pathogens. The lymph that collects in tissues slowly passes into tiny lymph vessels. It then travels from smaller to larger lymph vessels. Lymph is not pumped through lymph vessels like blood is pumped through blood vessels by the heart. Instead, muscles around the lymph vessels contract and squeeze the lymph through the vessels. The lymph vessels also contract to help move the lymph along. The lymph finally reaches the main lymph vessels in the chest. Here, the lymph drains into two large veins. This is how the lymph returns to the bloodstream.

1256,"Context: A lymphocyte is the type of white blood cell involved in an immune system response. You can see what a lymphocyte looks like, greatly magnified, in Figure 21.15. Lymphocytes make up about one quarter of all white blood cells, but there are trillions of them in the human body. Usually, fewer than half of the bodys lymphocytes are in the blood. The majority are in the lymph, lymph nodes, and lymph organs. There are two main types of lymphocytes, called B cells and T cells. Both types of lymphocytes are produced in bone marrow.

How can B and T cells recognize specific pathogens? Pathogens have unique antigens, often located on their cell surface. Antigens are proteins that the body recognizes either as self or nonself. Self antigens include those found on red blood cells that determine a persons blood type. Generally, the immune system doesnt respond to self antigens. Nonself antigens include those found on bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. Nonself antigens are also found on other cells, such as pollen cells and cancer cells.

1257,"Context: In previous concepts, you learned about B and T cells, special types of white blood cells that help your body to fight off a specific pathogen. They are necessary when the body is fighting off an infection. But what happens to them after the pathogen has been destroyed? Most B and T cells die after an infection has been brought under control. But some of them survive for many years. They may even survive for a persons lifetime. These long-lasting B and T cells are called memory cells. They allow the immune system to remember the pathogen after the infection is over. If the pathogen invades the body again, the memory cells will start dividing in order to fight the pathogen or disease. These dividing cells will quickly produce a new army of B or T cells to fight the pathogen. They will begin a faster, stronger attack than the first time the pathogen invaded the body. As a result, the immune system will be able to destroy the pathogen before it can cause an infection. Being able to attack the pathogen in this way is called immunity. Immunity can also be caused by vaccination. Vaccination is the process of exposing a person to a pathogen on purpose in order to develop immunity. In vaccination, a modified pathogen is usually injected under the skin by a shot. Only part of the pathogen is injected, or a weak or dead pathogen is used. It sounds dangerous, but the shot prepares your body for fighting the pathogen without causing the actual illness. Vaccination triggers an immune response against the injected antigen. The body prepares ""memory"" cells for use at a later time, in case the antigen is ever encountered again. Essentially, a vaccine imitates an infection, triggering an immune response, without making a person sick. In many countries, children receive their first vaccination at birth with the Hepatitis B shot, which protects infants from Hepatitis B, a serious liver disease. Before vaccines, many children died from diseases that vaccines now prevent, such as whooping cough, measles, and polio. Those same germs exist today, but because babies are now protected by vaccines, we do not see these diseases nearly as often. Diseases you have probably been vaccinated against include measles, mumps, and chicken pox. How does a vaccine work? See How a Vaccine Works at  and The History of Vaccines at  .

1258,"Context: There are different types of T cells, including killer T cells and helper T cells. Killer T cells destroy infected, damaged, or cancerous body cells ( Figure 1.2). When the killer T cell comes into contact with the infected cell, it releases poisons. The poisons make tiny holes in the cell membrane of the infected cell. This causes the cell to burst open. Both the infected cell and the pathogens inside it are destroyed. Helper T cells do not destroy infected or damaged body cells. But they are still necessary for an immune response. They help by releasing chemicals that control other lymphocytes. The chemicals released by helper T cells switch on both B cells and killer T cells so they can recognize and fight specific pathogens.

1261,"Context: The lymphatic system also plays an important role in the immune system. For example, the lymphatic system makes white blood cells that protect the body from diseases. Cells of the lymphatic system produce two types of white blood cells, T cells and B cells, that are involved in fighting specific pathogens. Lymph nodes, which are scattered throughout the lymphatic system, act as filters or traps for foreign particles and are important in the proper functioning of the immune system. The role of the lymphatic system in the immune response is discussed in additional concepts. 
Question: The majority of lymphocytes are in the lymphatic system
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
1262,"Context: B cells respond to pathogens in the blood and lymph. Most B cells fight infections by making antibodies. An antibody is a large, Y-shaped molecule that binds to an antigen. Each antibody can bind with just one specific type of antigen. The antibody and antigen fit together like a lock and key. You can see how this works in Figure 21.16. The antibody in the figure can bind only with the type of antigen that is colored yellow. Once the antibody binds with the antigen, it signals a phagocyte to engulf and destroy them, along with the pathogen that carries the antigen on its surface.

Question: B cells respond to pathogens that are inside infected cells.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
1263,"Context: There are different types of T cells, including killer T cells and helper T cells. Killer T cells destroy infected, damaged, or cancerous body cells ( Figure 1.2). When the killer T cell comes into contact with the infected cell, it releases poisons. The poisons make tiny holes in the cell membrane of the infected cell. This causes the cell to burst open. Both the infected cell and the pathogens inside it are destroyed. Helper T cells do not destroy infected or damaged body cells. But they are still necessary for an immune response. They help by releasing chemicals that control other lymphocytes. The chemicals released by helper T cells switch on both B cells and killer T cells so they can recognize and fight specific pathogens. 
Question: Helper T cells release chemicals that switch on B cells and killer T cells.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
1264,"Context: What can you do to avoid infectious diseases? Eating well and getting plenty of sleep are a good start. These habits will help keep your immune system healthy. With a healthy immune system, you will be able to fight off many pathogens. Vaccines are available for some infectious diseases. For example, there are vaccines to prevent measles, mumps, whooping cough, and chicken pox. These vaccines are recommended for infants and young children. You can also take the following steps to avoid picking up pathogens or spreading them to others. Watch this video for additional information on preventing the spread of infectious diseases:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Wash your hands often with soap and water. Spend at least 20 seconds scrubbing with soap. See Figure 21.3 for effective hand washing tips. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. This includes kissing, hugging, shaking hands, and sharing cups or eating utensils. Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or shirt sleeve, not your hands. Disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as keyboards and doorknobs, especially if someone is sick. Stay home when you are sick. The best way to prevent diseases spread by vectors is to avoid contact with the vectors. For example, you can wear long sleeves and long pants to avoid tick and mosquito bites. Using insect repellent can also reduce your risk of insect bites. 
Question: The only way to develop immunity to an infectious disease is by vaccination.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
1265,"Context: Getting the recommended vaccinations can help prevent diseases, such as whooping cough and flu. In fact, a yearly flu vaccine is recommended for everyone who is at least 6 months of age. The flu vaccine is especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications (like pneumonia) if they get sick with the flu. People who have certain medical conditions including asthma, diabetes, and chronic lung disease, pregnant women, and people younger than 5 years (and especially those younger than 2), and people 65 years and older should also make sure they get the yearly flu vaccine. Seeking medical help for diseases like asthma can help stop the disease from getting worse. If you are unsure if you should go to the doctor, call the doctors office and ask. 
Question: Vaccines have been developed to prevent measles, mumps, and chicken pox.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
1266,"Context: If pathogens get through the bodys first two lines of defense, a third line of defense takes over. This third line of defense involves the immune system. It is called an immune response, and is a specific type of response. The immune system has a special response for each type of pathogen. The immune system ( Figure 1.1) is also part of the lymphatic systemnamed for lymphocytes, which are the type of white blood cells involved in an immune response. They include several lymph organs, lymph vessels, lymph, and lymph nodes. This diagram shows the parts of the im- mune system. The immune system in- cludes several organs and a system of vessels that carry lymph. Lymph nodes are located along the lymph vessels. 
Question: The bodys third and final line of defense against pathogens involves the immune system.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
1267,"Context: Lymph vessels make up a circulatory system that is similar to the blood vessels of the cardiovascular system. However, lymph vessels circulate lymph instead of blood, and the heart does not pump lymph through the vessels. Lymph that collects in tissues slowly passes into tiny lymph vessels. Lymph then travels from smaller to larger lymph vessels. Muscles around the lymph vessels contract and squeeze the lymph through the vessels. The lymph vessels also contract to help move the lymph along. Eventually, lymph reaches the main lymph vessels, which are located in the chest. From these vessels, lymph drains into two large veins of the cardiovascular system. This is how lymph returns to the blood. Before lymph reaches the bloodstream, it passes through small oval structures called lymph nodes, which are located along the lymph vessels. Figure 21.14 shows where some of the bodys many lymph nodes are concentrated. Lymph nodes act like filters and remove pathogens from lymph. 
Question: Lymph is moved through lymphatic vessels by the force of gravity.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
1268,"Context: There are two different types of immune responses. Both types involve lymphocytes. However, one type of response involves B cells. The other type involves T cells. 
Question: Types of lymphocytes include phagocytes, B cells, and T cells.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
1269,"Context: Lymphocytes ( Figure 1.3), a type of white blood cell, are the key cells of an immune response. There are trillions of lymphocytes in the human body. They make up about one quarter of all white blood cells. Usually, fewer than half of the bodys lymphocytes are in the blood. The rest are in the lymph, lymph nodes, and lymph organs. There are two main types of lymphocytes: 1. B cells. This image of a lymphocyte was made with an electron microscope. The lym- phocyte is shown 10,000 times its actual size. 2. T cells. Both types of lymphocytes are produced in the red bone marrow. They are named for the sites where they grow larger. The ""B"" in B cells stands for bone. B cells grow larger in red bone marrow. The ""T"" in T cells stands for thymus. T cells mature in the thymus gland. B and T cells must be switched on in order to fight a specific pathogen. Once this happens, they produce an army of cells ready to fight that particular pathogen. How can B and T cells recognize specific pathogens? Pathogens have proteins, often located on their cell surface. These proteins are called antigens. An antigen is any protein that causes an immune response, because it is unlike any protein that the body makes. Antigens are found on bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. Your body sees these as foreign, meaning they do not belong in your body. 
Question: T cells are produced by the thymus gland.
Options:(A) true (B) false

1271,"Context: There are two different types of immune responses. Both types involve lymphocytes. However, one type of response involves B cells. The other type involves T cells. 
Question: One type of immune response involves killer T cells and one type involves helper T cells.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
1272,"Context: B cells respond to pathogens and other cells from outside the body in the blood and lymph. Most B cells fight infections by making antibodies. An antibody is a large, Y-shaped protein that binds to an antigen, a protein that is recognized as foreign. Antigens are found on the outside of bacteria, viruses and other foreign microorganisms. Each antibody can bind with just one specific type of antigen ( Figure 1.1). They fit together like a lock and key. Once an antigen and antibody bind together, they signal for a phagocyte to destroy them. Phagocytes are white blood cells that engulf targeted antigens by phagocytosis. As the antigen is on the outside of a pathogen, the pathogen is destroyed by this process. At any one time the average human body contains antibodies that can react with about 100,000,000 different antigens. This means that there can be 100,000,000 different antibody proteins in the body. 
Question: Antibodies are proteins that the body recognizes as either self or nonself.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
1273,"Context: You may think that your blood vessels have thick walls without any leaks, but thats not true. Blood vessels can leak just like any other pipe. The lymphatic system makes sure leaked blood returns back to the bloodstream. When a small amount of fluid leaks out from the blood vessels, it collects in the spaces between cells and tissues. Some of the fluid returns to the cardiovascular system, and the rest is collected by the lymph vessels of the lymphatic system ( Figure 1.2). The fluid that collects in the lymph vessels is called lymph. The lymphatic system then returns the lymph to the cardiovascular system. Unlike the cardiovascular system, the lymphatic system is not closed (meaning it is an open circulatory system that releases and collects fluid) and has no central pump (or heart). Lymph moves slowly in lymph vessels. It is moved along in the lymph vessels by the squeezing action of smooth muscles and skeletal muscles. Lymph capillaries collect fluid that leaks out from blood capillaries. The lymphatic vessels return the fluid to the cardiovas- cular system. 
Question: __liquid that normally leaks out of tiny blood vessels into tissues
Options:(A) aspleen (B) blymph node (C) cthymus gland (D) dbone marrow (E) eimmune response (F) flymphocyte (G) glymph
Answer:",G
1274,"Context: 1. As you can see above ( Figure 1.1), the kidneys are two bean-shaped organs. Kidneys filter and clean the blood and form urine. They are about the size of your fists and are found near the middle of the back, just below your ribcage. 2. Ureters are tube-shaped and bring urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. 3. The urinary bladder is a hollow and muscular organ. It is shaped a little like a balloon. It is the organ that collects urine. 4. Urine leaves the body through the urethra. The kidneys filter the blood that passes through them, and the urinary bladder stores the urine until it is released from the body. 
Question: __organ in the abdomen that filters pathogens out of the blood

Answer:",A
1275,"Context: The immune system is the body system that fights to protect the body from specific pathogens. It has a special response for each type of pathogen. The immune systems specific reaction to a pathogen is called an immune response. The immune system is shown in Figure 21.13. It includes several organs and a network of vessels that carry lymph. Lymph is a yellowish liquid that normally leaks out of tiny blood vessels into spaces between cells in tissues. When inflammation occurs, more lymph leaks into tissues, and the lymph is likely to contain pathogens. 
Question: __immune systems reaction to a specific pathogen
Options:(A) aspleen (B) blymph node (C) cthymus gland (D) dbone marrow (E) eimmune response (F) flymphocyte (G) glymph
Answer:",E
1276,"Context: A lymphocyte is the type of white blood cell involved in an immune system response. You can see what a lymphocyte looks like, greatly magnified, in Figure 21.15. Lymphocytes make up about one quarter of all white blood cells, but there are trillions of them in the human body. Usually, fewer than half of the bodys lymphocytes are in the blood. The majority are in the lymph, lymph nodes, and lymph organs. There are two main types of lymphocytes, called B cells and T cells. Both types of lymphocytes are produced in bone marrow. They are named for the sites where they grow and mature. The B in B cells stands for bone marrow, where B cells mature. The T in T cells stands for thymus gland, where T cells mature. Both B cells and T cells must be switched on in order to fight a specific pathogen. Once this happens, they produce an army of cells that are ready to fight that particular pathogen. How can B and T cells recognize specific pathogens? Pathogens have unique antigens, often located on their cell surface. Antigens are proteins that the body recognizes either as self or nonself. Self antigens include those found on red blood cells that determine a persons blood type. Generally, the immune system doesnt respond to self antigens. Nonself antigens include those found on bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. Nonself antigens are also found on other cells, such as pollen cells and cancer cells. It is these antigens that trigger an immune response. 
Question: __type of white blood cell involved in an immune response
Options:(A) aspleen (B) blymph node (C) cthymus gland (D) dbone marrow (E) eimmune response (F) flymphocyte (G) glymph
Answer:",F
1277,"Context: The lymphatic system is a network of vessels and tissues that carry a clear fluid called lymph. The lymphatic system ( Figure 1.1) spreads all around the body and filters and cleans the lymph of any debris, abnormal cells, or pathogens. Lymph vessels are tube-shaped, just like blood vessels, with about 500-600 lymph nodes (in an adult) attached. The lymphatic system works with the cardiovascular system to return body fluids to the blood. The lymphatic system and the cardiovascular system are often called the bodys two ""circulatory systems."" Organs of the lymphatic system include the tonsils, thymus gland and spleen. The thymus gland produces T cells or T-lymphocytes (see below) and the spleen and tonsils help in fighting infections. The spleens main function is to filter the blood, removing unwanted red blood cells. The spleen also detects viruses and bacteria and triggers the release of pathogen fighting cells. The lymphatic system helps return fluid that leaks from the blood vessels back to the cardiovascular system.

1279,"Context: Immune system organs include bone marrow, the thymus gland, the spleen, and the tonsils. Each organ has a different job in the immune system. Bone marrow is found inside many bones. Its role in the immune system is to produce white blood cells called lymphocytes. The thymus gland is in the chest behind the breast bone. It stores some types of lymphocytes while they mature. The spleen is in the abdomen below the lungs. Its job is to filter pathogens out of the blood. The two tonsils are located on either side of the throat. They trap pathogens that enter the body through the mouth or nose.

1280,"Context: By the early 1800s, scientists had seen cells in many different types of organisms. Every organism that was examined was found to consist of cells. From all these observations, German scientists Theodor Schwann and Matthias Schleiden drew two major conclusions about cells. They concluded that: cells are alive. all living things are made of cells. Around 1850, a German doctor named Rudolf Virchow was observing living cells under a microscope. As he was watching, one of the cells happened to divide. Figure 3.2 shows a cell dividing, like the cell observed by Virchow. This was an aha moment for Virchow. He realized that living cells produce new cells by dividing. This was evidence that cells arise from other cells. The work of Schwann, Schleiden, and Virchow led to the cell theory. This is one of the most important theories in life science. The cell theory can be summed up as follows: All organisms consist of one or more cells. Cells are alive and the site of all life processes. All cells come from pre-existing cells. 
Question: The scientist who discovered that all living cells arise from other cells was
Options:(A) Hooke (B) Schwann (C) Schleiden (D) Virchow
Answer:",D
1281,"Context: Cells are the basic building blocks of life. They are like tiny factories where virtually all life processes take place. Some living things, like the bacteria in Figure 2.1, consist of just one cell. They are called single-celled organisms. You can see other single-celled organisms in Figure 2.2. Some living things are composed of a few to many trillions of cells. They are called multicellular organisms. Your body is composed of trillions of cells. Regardless of the type of organism, all living cells share certain basic structures. For example, all cells are enclosed by a membrane. The cell membrane separates the cell from its environment. It also controls what enters or leaves the cell. 
Question: The cells of all living things have
Options:(A) a cell membrane (B) cytoplasm (C) ribosomes (D) all of the above
Answer:",D
1282,"Context: Prokaryotic cells are cells that lack a nucleus. The DNA in prokaryotic cells is in the cytoplasm, rather than enclosed within a nuclear membrane. All the organisms in the Bacteria and Archaea Domains have prokaryotic cells. No other organisms have this type of cell. Organisms with prokaryotic cells are called prokaryotes. They are all single-celled organisms. They were the first type of organisms to evolve. They are still the most numerous organisms today. You can see a model of a prokaryotic cell in Figure 3.3. The cell in the figure is a bacterium. Notice how it contains a cell membrane, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and several other structures. However, the cell lacks a nucleus. The cells DNA is circular. It coils up in a mass called a nucleoid that floats in the cytoplasm. 
Question: Which statement about prokaryotes is false?

Answer:",B
1284,"Context: There are two basic types of cells, prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells. The main difference between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells is that eukaryotic cells have a nucleus. The nucleus is where cells store their DNA, which is the genetic material. The nucleus is surrounded by a membrane. Prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus. Instead, their DNA floats around inside the cell. Organisms with prokaryotic cells are called prokaryotes. All prokaryotes are single-celled (unicellular) organisms. Bacteria and Archaea are the only prokaryotes. Organisms with eukaryotic cells are called eukaryotes. Animals, plants, fungi, and protists are eukaryotes. All multicellular organisms are eukaryotes. Eukaryotes may also be single-celled. Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have structures in common. All cells have a plasma membrane, ribosomes, cytoplasm, and DNA. The plasma membrane, or cell membrane, is the phospholipid layer that surrounds the cell and protects it from the outside environment. Ribosomes are the non-membrane bound organelles where proteins are made, a process called protein synthesis. The cytoplasm is all the contents of the cell inside the cell membrane, not including the nucleus. 
Question: Which level of organization is found in eukaryotes but not in prokaryotes?
Options:(A) atoms (B) molecules (C) cells (D) none of the above
Answer:",D
1285,"Context: Eukaryotic cells usually have multiple chromosomes, composed of DNA and protein. Some eukaryotic species have just a few chromosomes, others have close to 100 or more. These chromosomes are protected within the nucleus. In addition to a nucleus, eukaryotic cells include other membrane-bound structures called organelles. Organelles allow eukaryotic cells to be more specialized than prokaryotic cells. Pictured below are the organelles of eukaryotic cells ( Figure 1.1), including the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus. These will be discussed in additional concepts. DNA (chromatin) is stored. Organelles give eukaryotic cells more functions than prokaryotic cells.

1294,"Context: All living things reproduce to make the next generation. Organisms that do not reproduce will go extinct. As a result, there are no species that do not reproduce ( Figure 1.4). Some organisms reproduce asexually ( asexual reproduction), especially single-celled organisms, and make identical copies (or clones) of themselves. Other organisms reproduce sexually ( sexual reproduction), combining genetic information from two parents to make genetically unique offspring.

1295,"Context: Cells with different functions often vary in shape. They may also vary in size. However, all cells are very small. Even the largest organisms have microscopic cells. Cells are so small that their diameter is measured in micrometers. A micrometer is just one-millionth of a meter. Use the sliding scale at the following link to see how small cells and cell parts are compared with other objects. Why are cells so small? The answer has to do with the surface area and volume of cells. To carry out life processes, a cell must be able to pass substances into and out of the cell. For example, it must be able to pass nutrients into the cell and waste products out of the cell. Anything that enters or leaves a cell has to go through the cell membrane on the surface of the cell. A bigger cell needs more nutrients and creates more wastes. As the size of a cell increases, its volume increases more quickly that its surface area. If the volume of a cell becomes too great, it wont have enough surface area to transfer all of its nutrients and wastes. 
Question: As a cell gets bigger, its surface area increases more quickly than its volume.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
1296,"Context: All of the cells in the domain Eukarya keep their genetic material, or DNA, inside the nucleus. The domain Eukarya is made up of four kingdoms: 1. Plantae: Plants, such as trees and grasses, survive by capturing energy from the sun, a process called photo- synthesis. 2. Fungi: Fungi, such as mushrooms and molds, survive by ""eating"" other organisms or the remains of other organisms. These organisms absorb their nutrients from other organisms. 3. Animalia: Animals also survive by eating other organisms or the remains of other organisms. Animals range from tiny ants to the largest whales, and include arthropods, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals ( Figure 4. Protista: Protists are not all descended from a single common ancestor in the way that plants, animals, and fungi are. Protists are all the eukaryotic organisms that do not fit into one of the other three kingdoms. They include many kinds of microscopic one-celled (unicellular) organisms, such as algae and plankton, but also giant seaweeds that can grow to be 200 feet long. Plants, animals, fungi, and protists might seem very different, but remember that if you look through a microscope, you will find similar cells with a membrane-bound nucleus in all of them.

1299,"Context: All cells have certain parts in common. These parts include the cell membrane, cytoplasm, DNA, and ribosomes. The cell membrane is a thin coat of phospholipids that surrounds the cell. Its like the skin of the cell. It forms a physical boundary between the contents of the cell and the environment outside the cell. It also controls what enters and leaves the cell. The cell membrane is sometimes called the plasma membrane. Cytoplasm is the material inside the cell membrane. It includes a watery substance called cytosol. Besides water, cytosol contains enzymes and other substances. Cytoplasm also includes other cell structures suspended in the cytosol. DNA is a nucleic acid found in cells. It contains genetic instructions that cells need to make proteins. Ribosomes are structures in the cytoplasm where proteins are made. They consist of RNA and proteins. These four components are found in all cells. They are found in the cells of organisms as different as bacteria and people. How did all known organisms come to have such similar cells? The answer is evolution. The similarities show that all life on Earth evolved from a common ancestor.

1300,"Context: Some lipids contain the element phosphorus as well as oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. These lipids are called phospholipids. Two layers of phospholipid molecules make up most of the cell membrane in the cells of living things. Figure 9.22 shows how phospholipid molecules are arranged in a cell membrane. One end (the head) of each phospholipid molecule is polar and attracts water. This end is called hydrophilic (""water loving""). The other end (the tail) is nonpolar and repels water. This end is called hydrophobic (""water hating""). The nonpolar tails are on the inside of the membrane. The polar heads are on the outside of the membrane. These differences in polarity allow some molecules to pass through the membrane while keeping others out. You can see how this works in the video at the URL below.

Answer:",B
1306,"Context: By the early 1800s, scientists had seen cells in many different types of organisms. Every organism that was examined was found to consist of cells. From all these observations, German scientists Theodor Schwann and Matthias Schleiden drew two major conclusions about cells. They concluded that: cells are alive. all living things are made of cells. Around 1850, a German doctor named Rudolf Virchow was observing living cells under a microscope. As he was watching, one of the cells happened to divide. Figure 3.2 shows a cell dividing, like the cell observed by Virchow. This was an aha moment for Virchow. He realized that living cells produce new cells by dividing. This was evidence that cells arise from other cells. The work of Schwann, Schleiden, and Virchow led to the cell theory. This is one of the most important theories in life science. The cell theory can be summed up as follows: All organisms consist of one or more cells. Cells are alive and the site of all life processes. All cells come from pre-existing cells. 
Question: Scientists who contributed to the development of the cell theory included
Options:(A) Virchow (B) Schleiden (C) Schwann (D) all of the above
Answer:",D
1307,"Context: In 1858, after using microscopes much better than Hookes first microscope, Rudolf Virchow developed the hypoth- esis that cells only come from other cells. For example, bacteria, which are single-celled organisms, divide in half (after they grow some) to make new bacteria. In the same way, your body makes new cells by dividing the cells you already have. In all cases, cells only come from cells that have existed before. This idea led to the development of one of the most important theories in biology, the cell theory. Cell theory states that: 1. All organisms are composed of cells. 2. Cells are alive and the basic living units of organization in all organisms. 3. All cells come from other cells. As with other scientific theories, many hundreds, if not thousands, of experiments support the cell theory. Since Virchow created the theory, no evidence has ever been identified to contradict it.

1309,"Context: All living cells have certain things in common. Besides having the basic parts described above, all cells can perform the same basic functions. For example, all cells can use energy, respond to their environment, and reproduce. However, cells may also have special functions. Multicellular organisms such as you have many different types of specialized cells. Each specialized cell has a particular job. Cells with special functions generally have a shape that suits them for that job. Figure 3.5 shows four examples of specialized cells. Each type of cell in the figure has a different function. It also has a shape that helps it perform that function. The function of a nerve cell is to carry messages to other cells. It has many long arms that extend outward from the cell. The ""arms"" let the cell pass messages to many other cells at once. The function of a red blood cell is to carry oxygen to other cells. A red blood cell is small and smooth. This helps it slip through small blood vessels. A red blood cell is also shaped like a fattened disc. This gives it a lot of surface area for transferring oxygen. The function of a sperm cell is to swim through fluid to an egg cell. A sperm cell has a long tail that helps it swim. The function of a pollen cell is to pollinate flowers. The pollen cells in the figure have tiny spikes that help them stick to insects such as bees. The bees then carry the pollen cells to other flowers for pollination.

1323,"Context: The plasma membrane ( Figure 1.1) is made of a double layer of special lipids, known as phospholipids. The phospholipid is a lipid molecule with a hydrophilic (""water-loving"") head and two hydrophobic (""water-hating"") tails. Because of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic nature of the phospholipid, the molecule must be arranged in a specific pattern as only certain parts of the molecule can physically be in contact with water. Remember that there is water outside the cell, and the cytoplasm inside the cell is mostly water as well. So the phospholipids are arranged in a double layer (a bilayer) to keep the cell separate from its environment. Lipids do not mix with water (recall that oil is a lipid), so the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane acts as a barrier, keeping water out of the cell, and keeping the cytoplasm inside the cell. The cell membrane allows the cell to stay structurally intact in its water-based environment. The function of the plasma membrane is to control what goes in and out of the cell. Some molecules can go through the cell membrane to enter and leave the cell, but some cannot. The cell is therefore not completely permeable. ""Permeable"" means that anything can cross a barrier. An open door is completely permeable to anything that wants to enter or exit through the door. The plasma membrane is semipermeable, meaning that some things can enter the cell, and some things cannot. 
Question: Which statement about the cell membrane is false?

1330,"Context: Some lipids contain the element phosphorus as well as carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. These lipids are called phospholipids. Two layers of phospholipid molecules make up the cell membranes of living things. In the Figure One end of each phospholipid molecule is polar, so it has a partial electric charge. Water is also polar and has electrically charged ends, so it is attracted to the oppositely charged end of a phospholipid molecule. This end of the phospholipid molecule is described as hydrophilic, which means water loving. The other end of each phospholipid molecule is nonpolar and has no electric charge. This end of the phospho- lipid molecule repels polar water and is described as hydrophobic, or water hating. In the Figure 1.3, the hydrophilic ends of the phospholipid molecules are on the outsides of the cell membrane, and the hydrophobic ends are on the inside of the cell membrane.

1342,"Context: One example of passive transport is diffusion, when molecules move from an area of high concentration (large amount) to an area of low concentration (low amount). Molecules are said to naturally flow down their concentration gradient. This type of diffusion proceeds without an input of energy. In simple diffusion, molecules that are small and uncharged can freely diffuse across a cell membrane. They simply flow through the cell membrane. Simple diffusion does not require energy or need the assistance of a transport protein. Other larger or charged molecules that diffuse across a membrane may need assistance from a protein. Oxygen is a molecule that can freely diffuse across a cell membrane. For example, oxygen diffuses out of the air sacs in your lungs into your bloodstream because oxygen is more concentrated in your lungs than in your blood. Oxygen moves from the high concentration of oxygen in your lungs to the low concentration of oxygen in your bloodstream. Carbon dioxide, which is exhaled, moves in the opposite direction - from a high concentration in your bloodstream to a low concentration in your lungs.

Options:(A) sodium-potassium pump (B) facilitated diffusion (C) vesicle transport (D) endocytosis
Answer:",B
1343,"Context: Small molecules can pass through the plasma membrane through a process called diffusion. Diffusion is the movement of molecules from an area where there is a higher concentration (larger amount) of the substance to an area where there is a lower concentration (lower amount) of the substance ( Figure 1.1). The amount of a substance in relation to the total volume is the concentration. During diffusion, molecules are said to flow down their concentration gradient, flowing from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. Molecules flowing down a concentration gradient is a natural process and does not require energy. Diffusion can occur across a semipermeable membrane, such as the cell membrane, as long as a concentration gradient exists. Molecules will continue to flow in this manner until equilibrium is reached. At equilibrium, there is no longer an area of high concentration or low concentration, and molecules flow equally in both directions across the semipermeable membrane. At equilibrium, equal amounts of a molecule are entering and leaving a cell. Diffusion is the movement of a substance from an area of a higher amount toward an area of lower amount. A concentra- tion gradient initially exists across the cell membrane. Equilibrium is reached when there is an equal amount of the substance on both sides of the membrane.

1344,"Context: Hydrophilic molecules and very large molecules cant pass through the cell membrane by simple diffusion. They need help to pass through the membrane. The help is provided by proteins called transport proteins. This process is known as facilitated diffusion. There are two types of transport proteins: channel proteins and carrier proteins. They work in different ways. You can see how they work in Figure 4.3. A channel protein forms a tiny hole called a pore in the cell membrane. This allows water or hydrophilic molecules to bypass the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. A carrier protein binds with a diffusing molecule. This causes the carrier protein to change shape. As it does, it carries the molecule across the membrane. This allows large molecules to pass through the cell membrane.

1345,"Context: Active transport occurs when a substance passes through the cell membrane with the help of extra energy. This happens when a substance moves from an area where it is less concentrated to an area where it is more concentrated. This is the opposite of diffusion. The substance moves up, instead of down, the concentration gradient. Like rolling a ball uphill, this requires an input of energy. The energy comes from the molecule named ATP (adenosine triphosphate). The energy allows special transport proteins called pumps to move substances to areas of higher concentration.

1347,"Context: Molecules in the cell membrane allow it to be semipermeable. The membrane is made of a double layer of phospholipids (a ""bilayer"") and proteins ( Figure below). Recall that phospholipids, being lipids, do not mix with water. It is this quality that allows them to form the outside barrier of the cell. A single phospholipid molecule has two parts: 1. A polar head that is hydrophilic, or water-loving. 2. A fatty acid tail that is hydrophobic, or water-fearing. The cell membrane is made up of a phos- pholipid bilayer, two layers of phospho- lipid molecules. Notice the polar head group of the phospholipid is attached to the phosphate, and the tails are two fatty acid chains. The head group and tails are attached by a glycerol backbone. There is water found on both the inside and the outside of cells. Since hydrophilic means water-loving, and they want to be near water, the heads face the inside and outside of the cell where water is found. The water-fearing, hydrophobic tails face each other in the middle of the cell membrane, because water is not found in this space. The phospholipid bilayer allows the cell to stay intact in a water-based environment. An interesting quality of the plasma membrane is that it is very ""fluid"" and constantly moving, like a soap bubble. This fluid nature of the membrane is important in maintaining homeostasis. It allows the proteins in the membrane to float to areas where they are needed. Due to the composition of the cell membrane, small molecules such as oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass freely through the membrane, but other molecules, especially large molecules, cannot easily pass through the plasma membrane. These molecules need assistance to get across the membrane. That assistance will come in the form of transport proteins.

It moves from the side of the membrane where it is more concentrated to the side where it is less concentrated. You can see how this happens in Figure 4.2. Substances that cross cell membranes by simple diffusion must squeeze between the lipid molecules in the mem- brane. As a result, the diffusing molecules must be very small.

1353,"Context: Sometimes, molecules cannot move through the cell membrane on their own. These molecules need special transport proteins to help them move across the membrane, a process known as facilitative diffusion. These special proteins are called channel proteins or carrier proteins ( Figure 1.1), and they are attached to the cell membrane. In fact, they go through the cell membrane, from the inside of the cell to the outside. Channel proteins provide an open channel or passageway through the cell membrane for molecules to move across. Many channel proteins allow the diffusion of ions. Ions are charged atoms. The charge makes it difficult to cross the cell membrane without assistance. Channel proteins are specific for the molecule they transport. For example a sodium ion crosses the membrane through a channel protein specific for sodium ions. Carrier proteins bind and carry the molecules across the cell membrane. These proteins bind a molecule on one side of the membrane, change shape as they carry the molecule across the membrane, and deposit the molecule on the other side of the membrane. Even though a protein is involved in both these methods of transport, neither method requires energy. Therefore these are still types of passive transport.

1363,"Context: During active transport, molecules move from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration. This is the opposite of diffusion, and these molecules are said to flow against their concentration gradient. Active transport is called ""active"" because this type of transport requires energy to move molecules. ATP is the most common source of energy for active transport. As molecules are moving against their concentration gradients, active transport cannot occur without assistance. A carrier protein is always required in this process. Like facilitated diffusion, a protein in the membrane carries the molecules across the membrane, except this protein moves the molecules from a low concentration to a high concentration. These proteins are often called ""pumps"" because they use energy to pump the molecules across the membrane. There are many cells in your body that use pumps to move molecules. For example, your nerve cells (neurons) would not send messages to your brain unless you had protein pumps moving molecules by active transport. The sodium-potassium pump ( Figure 1.1) is an example of an active transport pump. The sodium-potassium pump uses ATP to move three sodium (Na+ ) ions and two potassium (K+ ) ions to where they are already highly concentrated. Sodium ions move out of the cell, and potassium ions move into the cell. How do these ions then return to their original positions? As the ions now can flow down their concentration gradients, facilitated diffusion returns the ions to their original positions either inside or outside the cell.

1373,"Context: As you can see in Figure 5.1, each nucleotide includes a sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogen base. The sugar in DNA is called deoxyribose. There are four different nitrogen bases in DNA: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). Chemical bonds between the bases hold the two strands of DNA together. Adenine always bonds with thymine, and cytosine always bonds with guanine. These pairs of bases are called complementary base pairs.

1374,"Context: During mitosis, the two sister chromatids must be divided. This is a precise process that has four individual phases to it. After the sister chromatids separate, each separate chromatid is now known as a chromosome. Each resulting chromosome is made of DNA from just one chromatid. So, each chromosome after this separation is made of ""1/2 of the X."" Through this process, each daughter cell receives one copy of each chromosome. The four phases of mitosis are prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase ( Figure 1.2). 1. Prophase: The chromatin, which is unwound DNA, condenses forming chromosomes. The DNA becomes so tightly wound that you can see them under a microscope. The membrane around the nucleus, called the nuclear envelope, disappears. Spindles also form and attach to chromosomes to help them move. 2. Metaphase: The chromosomes line up in the center, or the equator, of the cell. The chromosomes line up in a row, one on top of the next. 3. Anaphase: The two sister chromatids of each chromosome separate as the spindles pull the chromatids apart, resulting in two sets of identical chromosomes. 4. Telophase: The spindle dissolves and nuclear envelopes form around the chromosomes in both cells.

1378,"Context: After DNA replicates during interphase, the nucleus of the cell undergoes the four phases of meiosis I: 1. Prophase I: Chromosomes form, and the nuclear membrane breaks down. Centrioles move to opposite poles of the cell. Spindle fibers form between the centrioles. Heres whats special about meiosis: Homologous chromosomes pair up! You can see this in Figure below. 2. Metaphase I: Spindle fibers attach to the centromeres of the paired homologous chromosomes. The paired chromosomes line up at the center of the cell. 3. Anaphase I: Spindle fibers shorten, pulling apart the chromosome pairs. The chromosomes are pulled toward opposite poles of the cell. One of each pair goes to one pole. The other of each pair goes to the opposite pole. 4. Telophase I: The chromosomes uncoil, and the spindle fibers break down. New nuclear membranes form. Phases of meiosis I Meiosis I is followed by cytokinesis. Thats when the cytoplasm of the cell divides. Two haploid daughter cells result. Both of these cells go on to meiosis II.

1379,"Context: The process of cell division in eukaryotic cells is carefully controlled. The cell cycle ( Figure 1.1) is the life cycle of an eukaryotic cell, with cell division at the end of the cycle. Like a human life cycle, which is made up of different phases, like childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, the cell cycle also occurs in a series of phases. The first cell cycle begins with the formation of a zygote from the fusion of a male and female sex cell ( gamete). The steps of the cell cycle can be divided into two main components: interphase and the mitotic phase. Interphase is the stage when the cell mostly performs its everyday functions. For example, it is when a kidney cell does what a kidney cell is supposed to do. The cell also gets ready to divide during this time. The cell divides during the mitotic phase, which consists of mitosis and cytokinesis. Most of the cell cycle consists of interphase, the time between cell divisions. Interphase can be divided into three stages: 1. The first growth phase (G1): During the G1 stage, the cell doubles in size and doubles the number of organelles. 2. The synthesis phase (S): The DNA is replicated during this phase. In other words, an identical copy of all the cells DNA is made. This ensures that each new cell has a set of genetic material identical to that of the parental cell. This process is called DNA replication. 3. The second growth phase (G2): Proteins are synthesized that will help the cell divide. At the end of interphase, the cell is ready to enter mitosis. Shown is the cell cycle. Notice that most of the cell cycle is spent in Inter- phase (G1, S, and G2). Mitosis and cy- tokinesis occur during the Mitotic phase. Some cells may enter a resting phase dur- ing which progression through the cycle stops. During mitosis, the nucleus divides as the chromosomes are equally separated.

1397,"Context: RNA stands for ribonucleic acid. RNA is smaller than DNA. It can squeeze through pores in the membrane that encloses the nucleus. It copies instructions in DNA and carries them to a ribosome in the cytoplasm. Then it helps build the protein. RNA is not only smaller than DNA. It differs from DNA in other ways as well. It consists of one nucleotide chain rather than two chains as in DNA. It also contains the nitrogen base uracil (U) instead of thymine (T). In addition, it contains the sugar ribose instead of deoxyribose. You can see these differences in Figure 5.16.

1398,"Context: RNA consists of just one chain of nucleotides. DNA consists of two chains. Nitrogen bases on the two chains of DNA form hydrogen bonds with each other. Hydrogen bonds are relatively weak bonds that form between a positively charged hydrogen atom in one molecule and a negatively charged atom in another molecule. Hydrogen bonds form only between adenine and thymine, and between guanine and cytosine. These bonds hold the two chains together and give DNA is characteristic double helix, or spiral, shape. You can see the shape of the DNA molecule in the Figure 1.2. Sugars and phosphate groups form the backbone of each chain of DNA. The bonded bases are called base pairs.

1401,"Context: The bases in DNA do not pair randomly. When Erwin Chargaff looked closely at the bases in DNA, he noticed that the percentage of adenine (A) in the DNA always equaled the percentage of thymine (T), and the percentage of guanine (G) always equaled the percentage of cytosine (C). Watson and Cricks model explained this result by suggesting that A always pairs with T, and G always pairs with C in the DNA helix. Therefore A and T, and G and C, are ""complementary bases,"" or bases that always pair together, known as a base-pair. The base-pairing rules state that A will always bind to T, and G will always bind to C (Figure 1.2). For example, if one DNA strand reads ATGCCAGT, the other strand will be made up of the complementary bases: TACGGTCA. Hydrogen bonds hold the complementary bases together, with two bonds forming between an A and a T, and three bonds between a G and a C. The chemical structure of DNA includes a chain of nucleotides consisting of a 5- carbon sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogen base. Notice how the sugar and phosphate group form the backbone of DNA (strands highlighted in pink), with the hydrogen bonds between the bases joining the two strands. 
Question: Which of the following is an example of a complementary base pair in DNA?
Options:(A) adenine and guanine (B) cytosine and thymine (C) adenine and cytosine (D) cytosine and guanine

1402,"Context: You can see how a prokaryotic cell divides in Figure 5.4. This type of cell division is called binary fission. The cell simply splits into two equal halves. Binary fission occurs in bacteria and other prokaryotes. It takes place in three continuous steps: 1. The cells chromosome is copied to form two identical chromosomes. This is DNA replication. 2. The copies of the chromosome separate from each other. They move to opposite poles, or ends, of the cell. This is called chromosome segregation. 3. The cell wall grows toward the center of the cell. The cytoplasm splits apart, and the cell pinches in two. This is called cytokinesis.

Answer:",C
1403,"Context: Before a eukaryotic cell divides, the nucleus and other organelles must be copied. Only then will each daughter cell have all the needed structures. 1. The first step in eukaryotic cell division, as it is in prokaryotic cell division, is DNA replication. As you can see in Figure 5.5, each chromosome then consists of two identical copies. The two copies are called sister chromatids. They are attached to each other at a point called the centromere. 2. The second step in eukaryotic cell division is division of the cells nucleus. This includes division of the chromosomes. This step is called mitosis. It is a complex process that occurs in four phases. The phases of mitosis are described below. 3. The third step is the division of the rest of the cell. This is called cytokinesis, as it is in a prokaryotic cell. During this step, the cytoplasm divides, and two daughter cells form. These three steps are shown in Figure 5.6. 
Question: What is the first step in the division of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?
Options:(A) mitosis (B) interphase (C) cytokinesis (D) DNA replication
Answer:",D
1404,"Context: During meiosis II, the sister chromatids are separated and the gametes are generated. This cell division is similar to that of mitosis, but results in four genetically unique haploid cells. The steps are outlined below: 1. Prophase II: The chromosomes condense. 2. Metaphase II: The chromosomes line up one on top of each other along the middle of the cell, similar to how they line up in mitosis. The spindle is attached to the centromere of each chromosome. 3. Anaphase II: The sister chromatids separate as the spindle shortens and move to opposite ends of the cell. 4. Telophase II: A nuclear envelope forms around the chromosomes in all four cells. This is followed by cytokinesis. After cytokinesis, each cell has divided again. Therefore, meiosis results in four haploid genetically unique daughter cells, each with half the DNA of the parent cell ( Figure 1.3). In human cells, the parent cell has 46 chromosomes (23 pairs), so the cells produced by meiosis have 23 chromosomes. These cells will become gametes.

1405,"Context: In species with sexual reproduction, each cell of the body has two copies of each chromosome. For example, human beings have 23 different chromosomes. Each body cell contains two of each chromosome, for a total of 46 chromosomes. You can see the 23 pairs of human chromosomes in Figure 5.13. The number of different types of chromosomes is called the haploid number. In humans, the haploid number is 23. The number of chromosomes in normal body cells is called the diploid number. The diploid number is twice the haploid number. In humans, the diploid number is two times 23, or 46.

Answer:",A
1406,"Context: During meiosis I, the pairs of homologous chromosomes are separated from each other. This requires that they line up in their homologous paris during metaphase I. The steps are outlined below: 1. Prophase I: The homologous chromosomes line up together. During this time, a process that only happens in meiosis can occur. This process is called crossing-over ( Figure 1.2), which is the exchange of DNA between homologous chromosomes. Crossing-over forms new combinations of alleles on the resulting chromosome. Without crossing-over, the offspring would always inherit all of the alleles on one of the homologous chromo- somes. Also during prophase I, the spindle forms, the chromosomes condense as they coil up tightly, and the nuclear envelope disappears. 2. Metaphase I: The homologous chromosomes line up in their pairs in the middle of the cell. Chromosomes from the mother or from the father can each attach to either side of the spindle. Their attachment is random, so all of the chromosomes from the mother or father do not end up in the same gamete. The gamete will contain some chromosomes from the mother and some chromosomes from the father. 3. Anaphase I: The homologous chromosomes are separated as the spindle shortens, and begin to move to opposite sides (opposite poles) of the cell. 4. Telophase I: The spindle fibers dissolves, but a new nuclear envelope does not need to form. This is because, after cytokinesis, the nucleus will immediately begin to divide again. No DNA replication occurs between meiosis I and meiosis II because the chromosomes are already duplicated. After cytokinesis, two haploid cells result, each with chromosomes made of sister chromatids. Since the separation of chromosomes into gametes is random during meiosis I, this process results in different combinations of chromosomes (and alleles) in each gamete. With 23 pairs of chromosomes, there is a possibility of over 8 million different combinations of chromosomes (223 ) in a human gamete. During crossing-over, segments of DNA are exchanged between non-sister chro- matids of homologous chromosomes. Notice how this can result in an allele (A) on one chromatid being moved onto the other non-sister chromatid.

A cell with one set of chromosomes, such as a gamete, is haploid, referred to as n. Sex cells are haploid. When a haploid sperm (n) and a haploid egg (n) combine, a diploid zygote will be formed (2n). In short, when a diploid zygote is formed, half of the DNA comes from each parent.

1409,"Context: During asexual reproduction, fungi produce haploid spores by mitosis of a haploid parent cell. A haploid cell has just one of each pair of chromosomes. The haploid spores are genetically identical to the parent cell. Spores may be spread by moving water, wind, or other organisms. Wherever the spores land, they will develop into new hyphae only when conditions are suitable for growth. Yeasts are an exception. They reproduce asexually by budding instead of by producing spores. An offspring cell forms on a parent cell. After it grows and develops, it buds off to form a new cell. The offspring cell is genetically identical to the parent cell. You can see yeast cells budding in Figure 9.11.

1410,"Context: Sexual reproduction is more complicated. It involves two parents. Special cells called gametes are produced by the parents. A gamete produced by a female parent is generally called an egg. A gamete produced by a male parent is usually called a sperm. An offspring forms when two gametes unite. The union of the two gametes is called fertilization. You can see a human sperm and egg uniting in Figure 5.12. The initial cell that forms when two gametes unite is called a zygote.

1414,"Context: When humans reproduce, there are two parents involved. DNA must be passed from both the mother and father to the child. Humans cannot reproduce with just one parent; humans can only reproduce sexually. But having just one parent is possible in other eukaryotic organisms, including some insects, fish, and reptiles. These organisms can reproduce asexually, meaning the offspring (""children"") have a single parent and share the exact same genetic material as the parent. This is very different from reproduction in humans. Bacteria, being a prokaryotic, single- celled organism, must reproduce asexually. The advantage of asexual reproduction is that it can be very quick and does not require the meeting of a male and female organism. The disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that organisms do not receive a mix of traits from both parents. An organism that is born through asexual reproduction only has the DNA from the one parent. In fact, the offspring is genetically an exact copy of the parent. This can cause problems for the individual. For example, if the parent has a gene that causes a particular disease, the offspring will also have the gene that causes that disease. Organisms produced sexually may or may not inherit the disease gene because they receive a mix of their parents genes. Types of organisms that reproduce asexually include: 1. Prokaryotic organisms, like bacteria. Bacteria reproduce through binary fission, where they grow and divide in half ( Figure 1.1). First, their chromosome replicates and the cell enlarges. The cell then divides into two cells as new membranes form to separate the two cells. After cell division, the two new cells each have one identical chromosome. This simple process allows bacteria to reproduce very rapidly. 2. Flatworms, an invertebrate animal species. Flatworms divide in two, then each half regenerates into a new flatworm identical to the original, a process called fragmentation. 3. Different types of insects, fish, and lizards. These organisms can reproduce asexually through a process called parthenogenesis. Parthenogenesis happens when an unfertilized egg cell grows into a new organism. The resulting organism has half the amount of genetic material of the parent. Parthenogenesis is common in honeybees. In a hive, the sexually produced eggs become workers, while the asexually produced eggs become drones. 
Question: Some organisms can produce both sexually and asexually.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
1415,"Context: Sexual reproduction combines gametes from two parents. Gametes are reproductive cells, such as sperm and egg. As gametes are produced, the number of chromosomes must be reduced by half. Why? The zygote must contain genetic information from the mother and from the father, so the gametes must contain half of the chromosomes found in normal body cells. When two gametes come together at fertilization, the normal amount of chromosomes results. Gametes are produced by a special type of cell division known as meiosis. Meiosis contains two rounds of cell division without DNA replication in between. This process reduces the number of chromosomes by half. Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and each chromosome within a pair is called a homologous chromo- some. For each of the 23 chromosome pairs, you received one chromosome from your father and one chromosome from your mother. Alleles are alternate forms of genes found on chromosomes. Homologous chromosomes have the same genes, though they may have different alleles. So, though homologous chromosomes are very similar, they are not identical. The homologous chromosomes are separated when gametes are formed. Therefore, gametes have only 23 chromosomes, not 23 pairs.

1427,"Context: Sexual reproduction is typically slower. However, it also has an advantage. Sexual reproduction results in offspring that are all genetically different. This can be a big plus for a species. The variation may help it adapt to changes in the environment. How does genetic variation arise during sexual reproduction? It happens in three ways: crossing over, independent assortment, and the random union of gametes. Crossing over occurs during meiosis I. It happens when homologous chromosomes pair up during prophase I. The paired chromosomes exchange bits of DNA. This recombines their genetic material. You can see where crossing over has occurred in Figures 5.15 and 5.16. Independent assortment occurs when chromosomes go to opposite poles of the cell in anaphase I. Which chromosomes end up together at each pole is a matter of chance. You can see this in Figures 5.15 and 5.16 as well. In sexual reproduction, two gametes unite to produce an offspring. Which two gametes is a matter of chance. The union of gametes occurs randomly. Due to these sources of variation, each human couple has the potential to produce more than 64 trillion unique offspring. No wonder we are all different!

1428,"Context: During meiosis I, the pairs of homologous chromosomes are separated from each other. This requires that they line up in their homologous paris during metaphase I. The steps are outlined below: 1. Prophase I: The homologous chromosomes line up together. During this time, a process that only happens in meiosis can occur. This process is called crossing-over ( Figure 1.2), which is the exchange of DNA between homologous chromosomes. Crossing-over forms new combinations of alleles on the resulting chromosome. Without crossing-over, the offspring would always inherit all of the alleles on one of the homologous chromo- somes. Also during prophase I, the spindle forms, the chromosomes condense as they coil up tightly, and the nuclear envelope disappears. 2. Metaphase I: The homologous chromosomes line up in their pairs in the middle of the cell. Chromosomes from the mother or from the father can each attach to either side of the spindle. Their attachment is random, so all of the chromosomes from the mother or father do not end up in the same gamete. The gamete will contain some chromosomes from the mother and some chromosomes from the father. 3. Anaphase I: The homologous chromosomes are separated as the spindle shortens, and begin to move to opposite sides (opposite poles) of the cell. 4. Telophase I: The spindle fibers dissolves, but a new nuclear envelope does not need to form. This is because, after cytokinesis, the nucleus will immediately begin to divide again.

Its not certain how the three domains of life are related. Archaea were once thought to be offshoots of Bacteria that were adapted to extreme environments. For their part, Bacteria were considered to be ancestors of Eukarya. Scientists now know that Archaea share several traits with Eukarya that Bacteria do not share. How can this be explained? One hypothesis is that the first Eukarya formed when an archaean cell fused with a bacterial cell. By fusing, the two prokaryotic cells became the nucleus and cytoplasm of a new eukaryotic cell. If this hypothesis is correct, both prokaryotic domains are ancestors of Eukarya.

1441,"Context: What were these organisms that completely changed the progression of life on Earth by changing the atmosphere from anaerobic to aerobic? The oldest known fossils that are from organisms known to photosynthesize are cyanobac- teria. Cyanobacteria were present by 2.8 billion years ago, and some may have been around as far back as 3.5 billion years. Cyanobacteria were the dominant life forms in the Archean. Why would such a primitive life-form have been dominant in the Precambrian? Many cyanobacteria lived in reef-like structures known as stromatolites (Figure These rocks in Glacier National Park, Montana may contain some of the oldest fossil microbes on Earth. Modern cyanobacteria are also called blue-green algae. These organisms may consist of a single or many cells and they are found in many different environments (Figure 1.5).

1451,"Context: For many years, archaea were classified as bacteria. Like the bacteria, archaea lacked a nucleus and membrane- bound organelles and, therefore, were prokaryotic cells. However, when scientists compared the DNA of the two prokaryotes, they found that there were distinct differences. They concluded that there must be two distinct types of prokaryotes, which they named archaea and bacteria. Even though the two groups might seem similar, archaea have many features that distinguish them from bacteria: 1. The cell walls of archaea are distinct from those of bacteria. While bacteria have cell walls made up of the polymer peptidoglycan, most archaea do not have peptidoglycan in their cell walls. 2. The plasma membranes of the archaea are also made up of lipids that are distinct from those in bacteria. 3. The ribosomal proteins of the archaea are similar to those in eukaryotic cells, not those in bacteria. Although archaea and bacteria share some fundamental differences, they are still similar in many ways: 1. They both are single-celled, microscopic organisms that can come in a variety of shapes ( Figure 1.1). 2. Both archaea and bacteria have a single circular chromosome of DNA and lack membrane-bound organelles. 3. Like bacteria, archaea can have flagella to assist with movement.

1470,"Context: Plant-like protists are known as algae ( Figure 1.1). They are a large and diverse group. Plant-like protists are autotrophs. This means that they produce their own food. They perform photosynthesis to produce sugar by using carbon dioxide and water, and the energy from sunlight, just like plants. Unlike plants, however, plant-like protists do not have true stems, roots, or leaves. Most plant-like protists live in oceans, ponds, or lakes. Protists can be unicellular (single-celled) or multicellular (many-celled). Seaweed and kelp are examples of multicellular, plant-like protists. Kelp can be as large as trees and form a ""forest"" in the ocean ( Figure 1.2). Plant-like protists are essential to the ecosystem. They are the base of the marine food chain, and they produce oxygen through photosynthesis for animals to breathe. They are classified into a number of basic groups ( Table Red algae are a very large group of protists making up about 5,0006,000 species. They are mostly multicellular and live in the ocean.

That means they eat things outside of themselves instead of producing their own food. Animal-like protists are very small, measuring only about 0.010.5mm. Animal-like protists include the flagellates, ciliates, and the sporozoans. 
Question: ___common name for an animal-like protist
Options:(A) aflagellum (B) balga (C) clife cycle (D) dwater mold (E) epseudopod (F) fprotozoan (G) gslime mold
Answer:",F
1480,"Context: There are many different types of animal-like protists. They are different because they move in different ways. Flagellates have long flagella, or tails. Flagella rotate in a propeller-like fashion, pushing the protist through its environment ( Figure 1.1). An example of a flagellate is Trypanosoma, which causes African sleeping sickness. Other protists have what are called transient pseudopodia, which are like temporary feet. The cell surface extends out to form feet-like structures that propel the cell forward. An example of a protist with pseudopodia is the amoeba. The ciliates are protists that move by using cilia. Cilia are thin, very small tail-like projections that extend outward from the cell body. Cilia beat back and forth, moving the protist along. Paramecium has cilia that propel it. The sporozoans are protists that produce spores, such as the toxoplasma. These protists do not move at all. The spores develop into new protists. These flagellates all cause diseases in humans. A video of the animal-like amoeba can be viewed at: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Amoeba_engulfing_ 
Question: ___temporary extension of the cytoplasm that a protozoan uses to move

Answer:",E
1481,"Context: Many animals have a relatively simple life cycle. A general animal life cycle is shown in Figure 11.3. Most animals spend the majority of their life as diploid organisms. Just about all animals reproduce sexually. Diploid adults undergo meiosis to produce haploid sperm or eggs. Fertilization occurs when a sperm and an egg fuse. The diploid zygote that forms develops into an embryo. The embryo eventually develops into an adult, often going through one or more larval stages on the way. A larva (larvae, plural) is a distinct juvenile form that many animals go through before becoming an adult. The larval form may be very different from the adult form. For example, a caterpillar is the larval form of an insect that becomes a butterfly as an adult. 
Question: ___all the phases an organism goes through in its life time

Answer:",C
1482,"Context: Scientists think that protists are the oldest eukaryotes. If so, they must have evolved from prokaryotes. How did this happen? How did cells without organelles acquire them? What was the origin of mitochondria, chloroplasts, and other organelles? The most likely way organelles evolved is shown in Figure 9.2. First, smaller prokaryotic cells invaded, or were engulfed by, larger prokaryotic cells. The smaller cells benefited by getting nutrients and a safe place to live. The larger cells benefited by getting some of the organic molecules or energy released by the smaller cells. Eventually, the smaller cells evolved into organelles in the larger cells. After that, neither could live without the other. 
Question: Protists are thought to be the oldest eukaryotes.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
1483,"Context: Prokaryotes reproduce asexually. This can happen by binary fission or budding. In binary fission, a cell splits in two. First, the large circular chromosome is copied. Then the cell divides to form two new daughter cells. Each has a copy of the parent cells chromosome. In budding, a new cell grows from a bud on the parent cell. It only breaks off to form a new cell when it is fully formed. 
Question: Protists can reproduce only by budding or binary fission.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
1484,"Context: Fungus-like protists include slime molds and water molds, both shown in Figure 9.5. They exist as individual cells or as many cells that form a blob-like colony. They are probably ancestors of fungi. Like fungi, many fungus-like protists are decomposers. They absorb nutrients from dead logs, compost, and other organic remains Slime molds are commonly found on rotting organic matter such as compost. Swarms of cells move very slowly over the surface. They digest and absorb nutrients as they go. Water molds are commonly found in moist soil and surface water. Many water molds are plant pathogens or fish parasites.

1486,"Context: Plant-like protists are known as algae ( Figure 1.1). They are a large and diverse group. Plant-like protists are autotrophs. This means that they produce their own food. They perform photosynthesis to produce sugar by using carbon dioxide and water, and the energy from sunlight, just like plants. Unlike plants, however, plant-like protists do not have true stems, roots, or leaves. Most plant-like protists live in oceans, ponds, or lakes. Protists can be unicellular (single-celled) or multicellular (many-celled). Seaweed and kelp are examples of multicellular, plant-like protists. Kelp can be as large as trees and form a ""forest"" in the ocean ( Figure 1.2). Plant-like protists are essential to the ecosystem. They are the base of the marine food chain, and they produce oxygen through photosynthesis for animals to breathe. They are classified into a number of basic groups ( Table Red algae are a very large group of protists making up about 5,0006,000 species. They are mostly multicellular and live in the ocean.

1487,"Context: Animal-like protists are called protozoa (protozoan, singular). Most protozoa consist of a single cell. Protozoa are probably ancestors of animals. Protozoa are like animals in two ways: 1. Protozoa are heterotrophs. Heterotrophs get food by eating other organisms. Some protozoa prey on bacteria. Some are parasites of animals. Others graze on algae. Still others are decomposers that break down dead organic matter. 2. Almost all protozoa can move. They have special appendages for this purpose. You can see different types in Figure 9.3. Cilia (cilium, singular) are short, hair-like projections. Pseudopods are temporary extensions of the cytoplasm. Flagella are long, whip-like structures. Flagella are also found in most prokaryotes.

1490,"Context: Protists are eukaryotes, which means their cells have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Most, but not all, protists are single-celled. Other than these features, they have very little in common. You can think about protists as all eukaryotic organisms that are neither animals, nor plants, nor fungi. Although Ernst Haeckel set up the Kingdom Protista in 1866, this kingdom was not accepted by the scientific world until the 1960s. These unique organisms can be so different from each other that sometimes Protista is called the junk drawer"" kingdom. Just like a junk drawer, which contains items that dont fit into any other category, this kingdom contains the eukaryotes that cannot be put into any other kingdom. Therefore, protists can seem very different from one another.

1493,"Context: Despite the diversity of protists, they do share some traits. The cells of all protists have a nucleus. They also have other membrane-bound organelles. For example, all of them have mitochondria, and some of them have chloroplasts. Most protists consist of a single cell. Some are multicellular but they lack specialized cells. Most protists live in wet places. They are found in oceans, lakes, swamps, or damp soils. Many protists can move. Most protists also have a complex life cycle. The life cycle of an organism is the cycle of phases it goes through until it returns to the starting phase. The protist life cycle includes both sexual and asexual reproduction. Why reproduce both ways? Each way has benefits. Asexual reproduction is fast. It allows rapid population growth when conditions are stable. Sexual reproduction increases genetic variation.

1504,"Context: Almost all fungi can reproduce sexually. But why reproduce sexually when asexual reproduction is much quicker? Sexual reproduction brings together traits from the two parents. This increases the genetic diversity of the species. In plants and animals, sexual reproduction occurs when sperm and egg from two parents join to make a new individual. In fungi, however, two haploid hyphae meet together and their nuclei fuse. Instead of calling a hyphae male or female, they have different mating types, such as (+) and (-) ( Figure 1.2). The common mushroom, a fruiting body, results after sexual reproduction when two hyphae, one (+) and one (-), mate, forming a mycelium with sporangia. No- tice, when the sporangia burst, the spores are released from the fruiting body.

Answer:",D
1506,"Context: Many fungi get organic compounds from living organisms. They have close relationships with other species. A close relationship between two species is called a symbiotic relationship. Two symbiotic relationships in fungi are mycorrhiza and lichen. These relationships are beneficial for both species. Mycorrhiza is a relationship between a fungus and a plant. The fungus grows in or on the plants roots. The fungus benefits from easy access to food made by the plant. The plant benefits because the fungal hyphae absorb water and nutrients from the soil that the plant needs. Lichen is a relationship between a fungus and cyanobacteria or green algae. The fungus grows around the bacterial or algal cells. The fungus benefits by getting some of the food made by the photosynthetic cells. The bacteria or algae benefit by getting some of the water and nutrients absorbed by the fungus. You can see a picture of lichen in Figure 9.12. Some fungi have a different kind of relationship with plants. They are plant parasites. They get food from the plants and cause harm to the plants in return. Fungi are the major causes of disease in agricultural crops. They may eventually kill their plant hosts. Some fungi are animal parasites. The wasp in Figure 9.13 is infected with a fungus. The fungus is the white fuzzy matter on the dark brown moth.

1507,"Context: Other pathogens spread when they get on objects or surfaces. A fungus may spread in this way. For example, you can pick up the fungus that causes athletes foot by wearing shoes that an infected person has worn. You can also pick up this fungus from the floor of a public shower or other damp areas. After acne, athletes foot is the most common skin disease in the United States. Therefore, the chance of coming in contact with the fungus in one of these ways is fairly high. Bacteria that cause the skin disease impetigo, which causes blisters, can spread when people share towels or clothes. The bacteria can also spread through direct skin contact in sports like wrestling.

1511,"Context: Today, fungi are no longer classified as plants. We now know that they have important traits that set them apart from plants. Thats why they are placed in their own kingdom. How do fungi differ from plants? The cell walls of fungi are made of chitin. Chitin is a tough carbohydrate that also makes up the outer skeleton of insects. The cell walls of plants are made of cellulose. Fungi are heterotrophs that absorb food from other organisms. Plants are autotrophs that make their own food. The Fungus Kingdom is large and diverse. It may contain more than a million species. However, fewer than 100,000 species of fungi have been identified.

But they were wrong. Now, scientists know that fungi are not plants at all. Fungi are very different from plants. The main difference between plants and fungi is how they obtain energy. Plants are autotrophs, meaning that they make their own ""food"" using the energy from sunlight. Fungi are heterotrophs, which means that they obtain their ""food"" from outside of themselves. In other words, they must ""eat"" their food like animals do. But they dont really eat. Instead, they absorb their nutrients. Yeasts, molds, and mushrooms are all different kinds of fungi. There may be as many as 1.5 million species of fungi ( Figure 1.2). You can easily see bread mold and mushrooms without a microscope, but most fungi you cannot see. Fungi are either too small to be seen without a microscope, or they live where you cannot see them easilydeep in the soil, under decaying logs, or inside plants or animals.

1522,"Context: During asexual reproduction, fungi produce haploid spores by mitosis of a haploid parent cell. A haploid cell has just one of each pair of chromosomes. The haploid spores are genetically identical to the parent cell. Spores may be spread by moving water, wind, or other organisms. Wherever the spores land, they will develop into new hyphae only when conditions are suitable for growth. Yeasts are an exception. They reproduce asexually by budding instead of by producing spores. An offspring cell forms on a parent cell. After it grows and develops, it buds off to form a new cell. The offspring cell is genetically identical to the parent cell. You can see yeast cells budding in Figure 9.11.

1523,"Context: Today, fungi are no longer classified as plants. We now know that they have important traits that set them apart from plants. Thats why they are placed in their own kingdom. How do fungi differ from plants? The cell walls of fungi are made of chitin. Chitin is a tough carbohydrate that also makes up the outer skeleton of insects. The cell walls of plants are made of cellulose. Fungi are heterotrophs that absorb food from other organisms. Plants are autotrophs that make their own food. The Fungus Kingdom is large and diverse. It may contain more than a million species. However, fewer than 100,000 species of fungi have been identified.

1525,"Context: Yeasts grow as single cells. Other fungi grow into multicellular, thread-like structures. These structures are called hyphae (hypha, singular). You can see a photo of hyphae in Figure 9.8. They resemble plant roots. Each hypha consists of a group of cells surrounded by a tubular cell wall. A mass of hyphae make up the body of a fungus. The body is called the mycelium (mycelia, plural). A mycelium may range in size from microscopic to very large. In fact, the largest living thing on Earth is the mycelium of a single fungus. Nicknamed the humongous fungus, it grows in a forest in Oregon. A small part of the fungus is pictured in Figure 9.9. The giant fungus covers an area of 2384 acres. Thats about the size of 1,665 football fields! The fungus is estimated to be at least 2400 years old, but it could be much older.

1528,"Context: Active transport occurs when a substance passes through the cell membrane with the help of extra energy. This happens when a substance moves from an area where it is less concentrated to an area where it is more concentrated. This is the opposite of diffusion.

Question: your nerve cells pump sodium ions from the extracellular space into the cell. how do the sodium ions get back out of the cell?
Options:(A) by active transport (B) by simple diffusion (C) by facilitated diffusion (D) all of the above
Answer:",C
1533,"Context: During active transport, molecules move from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration. This is the opposite of diffusion, and these molecules are said to flow against their concentration gradient. Active transport is called ""active"" because this type of transport requires energy to move molecules. ATP is the most common source of energy for active transport. As molecules are moving against their concentration gradients, active transport cannot occur without assistance. A carrier protein is always required in this process. Like facilitated diffusion, a protein in the membrane carries the molecules across the membrane, except this protein moves the molecules from a low concentration to a high concentration. These proteins are often called ""pumps"" because they use energy to pump the molecules across the membrane. There are many cells in your body that use pumps to move molecules. For example, your nerve cells (neurons) would not send messages to your brain unless you had protein pumps moving molecules by active transport. The sodium-potassium pump ( Figure 1.1) is an example of an active transport pump. The sodium-potassium pump uses ATP to move three sodium (Na+ ) ions and two potassium (K+ ) ions to where they are already highly concentrated. Sodium ions move out of the cell, and potassium ions move into the cell. How do these ions then return to their original positions? As the ions now can flow down their concentration gradients, facilitated diffusion returns the ions to their original positions either inside or outside the cell.

1543,"Context: Bacteria, being single-celled prokaryotic organisms, do not have a male or female version. Bacteria reproduce asexually. In asexual reproduction, the ""parent"" produces a genetically identical copy of itself. 
Question: only single-celled organisms reproduce asexually.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
1544,"Context: When humans reproduce, there are two parents involved. DNA must be passed from both the mother and father to the child. Humans cannot reproduce with just one parent; humans can only reproduce sexually. But having just one parent is possible in other eukaryotic organisms, including some insects, fish, and reptiles. These organisms can reproduce asexually, meaning the offspring (""children"") have a single parent and share the exact same genetic material as the parent. This is very different from reproduction in humans. Bacteria, being a prokaryotic, single- celled organism, must reproduce asexually. The advantage of asexual reproduction is that it can be very quick and does not require the meeting of a male and female organism. The disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that organisms do not receive a mix of traits from both parents. An organism that is born through asexual reproduction only has the DNA from the one parent. In fact, the offspring is genetically an exact copy of the parent. This can cause problems for the individual. For example, if the parent has a gene that causes a particular disease, the offspring will also have the gene that causes that disease. Organisms produced sexually may or may not inherit the disease gene because they receive a mix of their parents genes. Types of organisms that reproduce asexually include: 1. Prokaryotic organisms, like bacteria. Bacteria reproduce through binary fission, where they grow and divide in half ( Figure 1.1). First, their chromosome replicates and the cell enlarges. The cell then divides into two cells as new membranes form to separate the two cells. After cell division, the two new cells each have one identical chromosome. This simple process allows bacteria to reproduce very rapidly. 2. Flatworms, an invertebrate animal species. Flatworms divide in two, then each half regenerates into a new flatworm identical to the original, a process called fragmentation. 3. Different types of insects, fish, and lizards. These organisms can reproduce asexually through a process called parthenogenesis. Parthenogenesis happens when an unfertilized egg cell grows into a new organism. The resulting organism has half the amount of genetic material of the parent. Parthenogenesis is common in honeybees. In a hive, the sexually produced eggs become workers, while the asexually produced eggs become drones. 
Question: which organisms can reproduce asexually?
Options:(A) bacteria (B) flatworms (C) some lizards (D) all of the above

1545,"Context: A cell with two sets of chromosomes is diploid, referred to as 2n, where n is the number of sets of chromosomes. Most of the cells in a human body are diploid. A cell with one set of chromosomes, such as a gamete, is haploid, referred to as n. Sex cells are haploid. When a haploid sperm (n) and a haploid egg (n) combine, a diploid zygote will be formed (2n). In short, when a diploid zygote is formed, half of the DNA comes from each parent.

1546,"Context: Bacteria reproduce through a process called binary fission. During binary fission, the chromosome copies itself, forming two genetically identical copies. Then, the cell enlarges and divides into two new daughter cells. The two daughter cells are identical to the parent cell. Binary fission can happen very rapidly. Some species of bacteria can double their population in less than ten minutes! This process makes it possible for a tremendous bacterial colony to start from a single cell. 
Question: how do bacteria make the next generation?
Options:(A) fragmentation (B) parthenogenesis (C) binary fusion (D) sexually
Answer:",C
1547,"Context: During sexual reproduction, two parents are involved. Most animals are dioecious, meaning there is a separate male and female sex, with the male producing sperm and the female producing eggs. When a sperm and egg meet during fertilization, a zygote, the first cell of a new organism, is formed ( Figure 1.2). This process combines the genetic material from both parents. The resulting organism will be genetically unique. The zygote will divide by mitosis and grow into the embryo. Lets explore how animals, plants, and fungi reproduce sexually: Animals often have gonads, organs that produce eggs or sperm. The male gonads are the testes, and the female gonads are the ovaries. Testes produce sperm; ovaries produce eggs. Sperm and egg, the two sex cells, are known as gametes, and can combine two different ways, both of which combine the genetic material from the two parents. Gametes have half the amount of the genetic material of a regular body cell; they are haploid cells. In humans, gametes have one set of 23 chromosomes. Gametes are produced through a special type of cell division known as meiosis. Normal human cells have 46 chromosomes. They are diploid cells, with two sets of 23 chromosomes (23 pairs). Bacteria reproduce by binary fission. Shown is one bacterium reproducing and becoming two bacteria. During sexual reproduction, a sperm fer- tilizes an egg. Fish and other aquatic animals release their gametes in the water, which is called external fertilization ( Figure by internal fertilization. Typically males have a penis that deposits sperm into the vagina of the female. Birds do not have penises, but they do have a chamber called the cloaca that they place close to another birds cloaca to deposit sperm. Amphibians must live close to water as they must lay their eggs in a moist or wet environment prior to external fertilization. This fish guards her eggs, which will be fertilized externally. Plants can also reproduce sexually, but their reproductive organs are different from animals gonads. Plants that have flowers have their reproductive parts in the flower. The sperm is contained in the pollen, while the egg is contained in the ovary, deep within the flower. The sperm can reach the egg two different ways: 1. In self-pollination, the egg is fertilized by the pollen of the same flower. 2. In cross-pollination, sperm from the pollen of one flower fertilizes the egg of another flower. Like other types of sexual reproduction, cross-pollination allows new combinations of traits. Cross-pollination occurs when pollen is carried by the wind to another flower. It can also occur when animal pollinators, like honeybees or butterflies ( Figure 1.4), carry the pollen from flower to flower. Butterflies receive nectar when they de- posit pollen into flowers, resulting in cross-pollination.

1549,"Context: B cells respond to pathogens and other cells from outside the body in the blood and lymph. Most B cells fight infections by making antibodies. An antibody is a large, Y-shaped protein that binds to an antigen, a protein that is recognized as foreign. Antigens are found on the outside of bacteria, viruses and other foreign microorganisms. Each antibody can bind with just one specific type of antigen ( Figure 1.1). They fit together like a lock and key. Once an antigen and antibody bind together, they signal for a phagocyte to destroy them. Phagocytes are white blood cells that engulf targeted antigens by phagocytosis. As the antigen is on the outside of a pathogen, the pathogen is destroyed by this process. At any one time the average human body contains antibodies that can react with about 100,000,000 different antigens. This means that there can be 100,000,000 different antibody proteins in the body.

1551,"Context: There are different types of T cells, including killer T cells and helper T cells. Killer T cells destroy infected, damaged, or cancerous body cells ( Figure 1.2). When the killer T cell comes into contact with the infected cell, it releases poisons. The poisons make tiny holes in the cell membrane of the infected cell. This causes the cell to burst open. Both the infected cell and the pathogens inside it are destroyed. Helper T cells do not destroy infected or damaged body cells. But they are still necessary for an immune response. They help by releasing chemicals that control other lymphocytes. The chemicals released by helper T cells switch on both B cells and killer T cells so they can recognize and fight specific pathogens.

When the killer T cell comes into contact with the infected cell, it releases poisons. The poisons make tiny holes in the cell membrane of the infected cell. This causes the cell to burst open. Both the infected cell and the pathogens inside it are destroyed. Helper T cells do not destroy infected or damaged body cells. But they are still necessary for an immune response. They help by releasing chemicals that control other lymphocytes. The chemicals released by helper T cells switch on both B cells and killer T cells so they can recognize and fight specific pathogens. 
Question: how do helper t cells do their job?
Options:(A) They help to make antibodies (B) They help by poisoning infected cells (C) They release chemicals that activate other T cells and B cells (D) They help by marking infected cells for destruction

1555,"Context: Some defenses, like your skin and mucous membranes, are not designed to ward off a specific pathogen. They are just general defenders against disease. Your body also has defenses that are more specialized. Through the help of your immune system, your body can generate an army of cells to kill that one specific pathogen. There are two different types of specific immune responses. One type involves B cells. The other type involves T cells. Recall that B cells and T cells are types of white blood cells that are key in the immune response. Whereas the immune systems first and second line of defense are more generalized or non-specific, the immune response is specific. It can be described as a specific response to a specific pathogen, meaning it uses methods to target just one pathogen at a time. These methods involve B and T cells. 
Question: what statement best describes the immune response?
Options:(A) The immune response fights pathogens by producing antigens (B) The immune response fights pathogens with B and T cells (C) The immune response is a general response to a specific pathogen (D) The immune response is a specific response to a specific pathogen

1558,"Context: Some bacteria also have tail-like structures called flagella ( Figure 1.3). Flagella help bacteria move. As the flagella rotate, they spin the bacteria and propel them forward. It is often said the flagella looks like a tiny whip, propelling the bacteria forward. Though some eukaryotic cells do have a flagella, a flagella in eukaryotes is rare. The flagella facilitate movement in bacte- ria. Bacteria may have one, two, or many flagellaor none at all.

1559,"Context: Bacteria are surrounded by a cell wall consisting of peptidoglycan. This complex molecule consists of sugars and amino acids. The cell wall is important for protecting bacteria. The cell wall is so important that some antibiotics, such as penicillin, kill bacteria by preventing the cell wall from forming. Some bacteria depend on a host organism for energy and nutrients. These bacteria are known as parasites. If the host starts attacking the parasitic bacteria, the bacteria release a layer of slime that surrounds the cell wall. This slime offers an extra layer of protection.

1563,"Context: Bacteria reproduce through a process called binary fission. During binary fission, the chromosome copies itself, forming two genetically identical copies. Then, the cell enlarges and divides into two new daughter cells. The two daughter cells are identical to the parent cell. Binary fission can happen very rapidly. Some species of bacteria can double their population in less than ten minutes! This process makes it possible for a tremendous bacterial colony to start from a single cell.

1571,"Context: Anemia is a disease that occurs when there is not enough hemoglobin in the blood to carry oxygen to body cells. Hemoglobin is the blood protein that normally carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. Anemia leads to a lack of oxygen in organs. Anemia is usually caused by one of the following: A loss of blood from a bleeding wound or a slow leak of blood. The destruction of red blood cells. A lack of red blood cell production. Anemia may not have any symptoms. Some people with anemia feel weak or tired in general or during exercise. They also may have poor concentration. People with more severe anemia often get short of breath during times of activity. Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia. It occurs when the body does not receive enough iron. Since there is not enough iron, hemoglobin, which needs iron to bind oxygen, cannot function properly. In the United States, 20% of all women of childbearing age have iron-deficiency anemia, compared with only 2% of adult men. The most common cause of iron-deficiency anemia in young women is blood lost during menstruation. Iron deficiency anemia can be avoided by getting the recommended amount of iron in ones diet. Anemia is often treated or prevented by taking iron supplements. Boys and girls between the ages of 9 and 13 should get 9 mg of iron every day. Girls between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 15 mg of iron every day. Boys between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 11 mg of iron every day. Pregnant women need the most iron27 mg daily. Good sources of iron include shellfish, such as clams and oysters. Red meats, such as beef, are also a good source of iron. Non-animal sources of iron include seeds, nuts, and legumes. Breakfast cereals often have iron added to them in a process called fortification. Some good sources of iron are listed below ( Table 1.1). Eating vitamin C along with iron-containing food increases the amount of iron that the body can absorb. Food Canned clams, drained, 3 oz. Fortified dry cereals, about 1 oz.

1572,"Context: Blood cancers affect the production and function of your blood cells. Most of these cancers start in your bone marrow where blood is produced. In most blood cancers, the normal production of blood cells is replaced by uncontrolled growth of an abnormal type of blood cell. These abnormal blood cells are cancerous cells, and prevent your blood from performing many of its functions, like fighting off infections or preventing serious bleeding. Leukemia is a cancer of the blood or bone marrow. It is characterized by an abnormal production of blood cells, usually white blood cells. Lymphoma is a cancer of a type of white blood cell called lymphocytes. There are many types of lymphoma.

1575,"Context: Red blood cells (RBCs) are flattened, disk-shaped cells that carry oxygen. They are the most common blood cell in the blood. There are about 4 to 6 million RBCs per cubic millimeter of blood. Each RBC has about 200 million molecules of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein that carries oxygen. Hemoglobin also gives the red blood cells their red color. Red blood cells ( Figure 1.2) are made in the red marrow of long bones, rib bones, the skull, and vertebrae. Each red blood cell lives for only 120 days (about four months). After this time, they are destroyed in the liver and spleen. Mature red blood cells do not have a nucleus or other organelles. Lacking these components allows the cells to have more hemoglobin and carry more oxygen. The flattened shape of red blood cells helps them carry more oxygen than if they were rounded. 
Question: why is the shape of red blood cells important?

1578,"Context: Although cells share many of the same features and structures, they also can be very different ( Figure 1.3). Each cell in your body is designed for a specific task. In other words, the cells function is partly based on the cells structure. For example: Red blood cells are shaped with a pocket that traps oxygen and brings it to other body cells. Nerve cells are long and stringy in order to form a line of communication with other nerve cells, like a wire. Because of this shape, they can quickly send signals, such as the feeling of touching a hot stove, to your brain. Skin cells are flat and fit tightly together to protect your body. As you can see, cells are shaped in ways that help them do their jobs. Multicellular (many-celled) organisms have many types of specialized cells in their bodies. Red blood cells (left) are specialized to carry oxygen in the blood. Neurons (cen- ter ) are shaped to conduct electrical im- pulses to many other nerve cells. These epidermal cells (right) make up the skin of plants. Note how the cells fit tightly together.

The second is a fact drawn from the prior observations. The third is an opinion, since she might actually have allergies or the flu. Tests could be done to see what is causing her illness. 3. This is a fact. Many, many scientific experiments have shown that colds are caused by viruses. 4. While that sounds like a fact, the scientific evidence is mixed. One reputable study published in 2007 showed a decrease of 58%, but several other studies have shown no beneficial effect. 5. Bill Gates is the wealthiest man in the United States; thats a fact. But theres no evidence that hes also the smartest man, and chances are hes not. This is an opinion. 6. This sounds like a fact, but it is not. It is easy to test. Gather together a large number of subjects, each with a friend. Have the friends fill out a questionnaire describing the subject. Match the traits against the persons astrological sign to see if the astrological predictions fit. Are Leos actually more fiery, self assured, and charming? Tests like this have not supported the claims of astrologers, yet astrologers have not modified their opinions. 7. This is a fact. The Figure 1.2 shows the temperature anomaly since 1880.

1582,"Context: In 1858, after using microscopes much better than Hookes first microscope, Rudolf Virchow developed the hypoth- esis that cells only come from other cells. For example, bacteria, which are single-celled organisms, divide in half (after they grow some) to make new bacteria. In the same way, your body makes new cells by dividing the cells you already have. In all cases, cells only come from cells that have existed before. This idea led to the development of one of the most important theories in biology, the cell theory. Cell theory states that: 1. All organisms are composed of cells. 2. Cells are alive and the basic living units of organization in all organisms. 3. All cells come from other cells. As with other scientific theories, many hundreds, if not thousands, of experiments support the cell theory. Since Virchow created the theory, no evidence has ever been identified to contradict it.

He saw that cork was divided into many tiny compartments, like little rooms. (Do the cells in Figure 3.1 look like little rooms to you too?) Hooke called these little rooms cells. Cork comes from trees, so what Hooke observed was dead plant cells. In the late 1600s, Dutch scientist Anton van Leeuwenhoek made more powerful microscopes. He used them to observe cells of other organisms. For example, he saw human blood cells and bacterial cells. Over the next century, microscopes were improved and more cells were observed.

Question: cell division occurs at the end of the cell cycle.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
1586,"Context: The process of cell division in eukaryotic cells is carefully controlled. The cell cycle ( Figure 1.1) is the life cycle of an eukaryotic cell, with cell division at the end of the cycle. Like a human life cycle, which is made up of different phases, like childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, the cell cycle also occurs in a series of phases. The first cell cycle begins with the formation of a zygote from the fusion of a male and female sex cell ( gamete). The steps of the cell cycle can be divided into two main components: interphase and the mitotic phase. Interphase is the stage when the cell mostly performs its everyday functions. For example, it is when a kidney cell does what a kidney cell is supposed to do. The cell also gets ready to divide during this time. The cell divides during the mitotic phase, which consists of mitosis and cytokinesis. Most of the cell cycle consists of interphase, the time between cell divisions. Interphase can be divided into three stages: 1. The first growth phase (G1): During the G1 stage, the cell doubles in size and doubles the number of organelles. 2. The synthesis phase (S): The DNA is replicated during this phase. In other words, an identical copy of all the cells DNA is made. This ensures that each new cell has a set of genetic material identical to that of the parental cell. This process is called DNA replication. 3. The second growth phase (G2): Proteins are synthesized that will help the cell divide. At the end of interphase, the cell is ready to enter mitosis. Shown is the cell cycle. Notice that most of the cell cycle is spent in Inter- phase (G1, S, and G2). Mitosis and cy- tokinesis occur during the Mitotic phase. Some cells may enter a resting phase dur- ing which progression through the cycle stops. During mitosis, the nucleus divides as the chromosomes are equally separated. One nucleus becomes two nuclei, each with an identical set of chromosomes. Mitosis is followed by cytokinesis, when the cytoplasm divides,

1587,"Context: The process of cell division in eukaryotic cells is carefully controlled. The cell cycle ( Figure 1.1) is the life cycle of an eukaryotic cell, with cell division at the end of the cycle. Like a human life cycle, which is made up of different phases, like childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, the cell cycle also occurs in a series of phases. The first cell cycle begins with the formation of a zygote from the fusion of a male and female sex cell ( gamete). The steps of the cell cycle can be divided into two main components: interphase and the mitotic phase. Interphase is the stage when the cell mostly performs its everyday functions. For example, it is when a kidney cell does what a kidney cell is supposed to do. The cell also gets ready to divide during this time. The cell divides during the mitotic phase, which consists of mitosis and cytokinesis. Most of the cell cycle consists of interphase, the time between cell divisions. Interphase can be divided into three stages: 1. The first growth phase (G1): During the G1 stage, the cell doubles in size and doubles the number of organelles. 2. The synthesis phase (S): The DNA is replicated during this phase. In other words, an identical copy of all the cells DNA is made. This ensures that each new cell has a set of genetic material identical to that of the parental cell. This process is called DNA replication. 3. The second growth phase (G2): Proteins are synthesized that will help the cell divide. At the end of interphase, the cell is ready to enter mitosis. Shown is the cell cycle. Notice that most of the cell cycle is spent in Inter- phase (G1, S, and G2). Mitosis and cy- tokinesis occur during the Mitotic phase. Some cells may enter a resting phase dur- ing which progression through the cycle stops. During mitosis, the nucleus divides as the chromosomes are equally separated. One nucleus becomes two nuclei, each with an identical set of chromosomes. Mitosis is followed by cytokinesis, when the cytoplasm divides,

1588,"Context: During meiosis II, the sister chromatids are separated and the gametes are generated. This cell division is similar to that of mitosis, but results in four genetically unique haploid cells. The steps are outlined below: 1. Prophase II: The chromosomes condense. 2. Metaphase II: The chromosomes line up one on top of each other along the middle of the cell, similar to how they line up in mitosis. The spindle is attached to the centromere of each chromosome. 3. Anaphase II: The sister chromatids separate as the spindle shortens and move to opposite ends of the cell. 4. Telophase II: A nuclear envelope forms around the chromosomes in all four cells. This is followed by cytokinesis. After cytokinesis, each cell has divided again. Therefore, meiosis results in four haploid genetically unique daughter cells, each with half the DNA of the parent cell ( Figure 1.3). In human cells, the parent cell has 46 chromosomes (23 pairs), so the cells produced by meiosis have 23 chromosomes. These cells will become gametes.

Options:(A) two cells (B) two genetically identical cells (C) two genetically identical nuclei (D) a cell ready for cell division
Answer:",B
1589,"Context: The genetic information of the cell, or DNA, is stored in the nucleus. During mitosis, two nuclei (plural for nucleus) must form, so that one nucleus can be in each of the new cells after the cell divides. In order to create two genetically identical nuclei, DNA inside of the nucleus must be copied or replicated. This occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle. During mitosis, the copied DNA is divided into two complete sets, so that after cytokinesis, each cell has a complete set of genetic instructions.

1596,"Context: During mitosis, the two sister chromatids must be divided. This is a precise process that has four individual phases to it. After the sister chromatids separate, each separate chromatid is now known as a chromosome. Each resulting chromosome is made of DNA from just one chromatid. So, each chromosome after this separation is made of ""1/2 of the X."" Through this process, each daughter cell receives one copy of each chromosome. The four phases of mitosis are prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase ( Figure 1.2). 1. Prophase: The chromatin, which is unwound DNA, condenses forming chromosomes. The DNA becomes so tightly wound that you can see them under a microscope. The membrane around the nucleus, called the nuclear envelope, disappears. Spindles also form and attach to chromosomes to help them move. 2. Metaphase: The chromosomes line up in the center, or the equator, of the cell. The chromosomes line up in a row, one on top of the next. 3. Anaphase: The two sister chromatids of each chromosome separate as the spindles pull the chromatids apart, resulting in two sets of identical chromosomes. 4. Telophase: The spindle dissolves and nuclear envelopes form around the chromosomes in both cells. An overview of the cell cycle and mito- sis: during prophase the chromosomes condense, during metaphase the chromo- somes line up, during anaphase the sister chromatids are pulled to opposite sides of the cell, and during telophase the nuclear envelope forms. This is a representation of dividing plant cells. Cell division in plant cells differs slightly from animal cells as a cell wall must form. Note that most of the cells are in interphase. Can you find examples of the different stages of mitosis?

1598,"Context: The inside of all cells also contain a jelly-like substance called cytosol. Cytosol is composed of water and other molecules, including enzymes, which are proteins that speed up the cells chemical reactions. Everything in the cell sits in the cytosol, like fruit in a jello mold. The term cytoplasm refers to the cytosol and all of the organelles, the specialized compartments of the cell. The cytoplasm does not include the nucleus. As a prokaryotic cell does not have a nucleus, the DNA is in the cytoplasm.

1599,"Context: The plasma membrane ( Figure 1.1) is made of a double layer of special lipids, known as phospholipids. The phospholipid is a lipid molecule with a hydrophilic (""water-loving"") head and two hydrophobic (""water-hating"") tails. Because of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic nature of the phospholipid, the molecule must be arranged in a specific pattern as only certain parts of the molecule can physically be in contact with water. Remember that there is water outside the cell, and the cytoplasm inside the cell is mostly water as well. So the phospholipids are arranged in a double layer (a bilayer) to keep the cell separate from its environment. Lipids do not mix with water (recall that oil is a lipid), so the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane acts as a barrier, keeping water out of the cell, and keeping the cytoplasm inside the cell. The cell membrane allows the cell to stay structurally intact in its water-based environment. The function of the plasma membrane is to control what goes in and out of the cell. Some molecules can go through the cell membrane to enter and leave the cell, but some cannot. The cell is therefore not completely permeable. ""Permeable"" means that anything can cross a barrier. An open door is completely permeable to anything that wants to enter or exit through the door. The plasma membrane is semipermeable, meaning that some things can enter the cell, and some things cannot.

1602,"Context: Molecules in the cell membrane allow it to be semipermeable. The membrane is made of a double layer of phospholipids (a ""bilayer"") and proteins ( Figure below). Recall that phospholipids, being lipids, do not mix with water. It is this quality that allows them to form the outside barrier of the cell. A single phospholipid molecule has two parts: 1. A polar head that is hydrophilic, or water-loving. 2. A fatty acid tail that is hydrophobic, or water-fearing. The cell membrane is made up of a phos- pholipid bilayer, two layers of phospho- lipid molecules. Notice the polar head group of the phospholipid is attached to the phosphate, and the tails are two fatty acid chains. The head group and tails are attached by a glycerol backbone. There is water found on both the inside and the outside of cells. Since hydrophilic means water-loving, and they want to be near water, the heads face the inside and outside of the cell where water is found. The water-fearing, hydrophobic tails face each other in the middle of the cell membrane, because water is not found in this space. The phospholipid bilayer allows the cell to stay intact in a water-based environment. An interesting quality of the plasma membrane is that it is very ""fluid"" and constantly moving, like a soap bubble. This fluid nature of the membrane is important in maintaining homeostasis. It allows the proteins in the membrane to float to areas where they are needed. Due to the composition of the cell membrane, small molecules such as oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass freely through the membrane, but other molecules, especially large molecules, cannot easily pass through the plasma membrane. These molecules need assistance to get across the membrane. That assistance will come in the form of transport proteins. 
Question: the middle of the cell membrane bilayer is an area without __________.
Options:(A) proteins (B) enzymes (C) water (D) phospholipids
Answer:",C
1603,"Context: The cell membrane is semipermeable, or selectively permeable, which means that only some molecules can pass through the membrane. If the cell membrane were completely permeable, the inside of the cell would be the same as the outside of the cell. It would be impossible for the cell to maintain homeostasis. Homeostasis means maintaining a stable internal environment. For example, if your body cells have a temperature of 98.6 F, and it is freezing outside, your cells will maintain homeostasis if the temperature of the cells stays the same and does not drop with the outside temperature. How does the cell ensure it is semipermeable? How does the cell control what molecules enter and leave the cell? The composition of the cell membrane helps to control what can pass through it. 
Question: the cell membrane keeps __________ out of the cell, and keeps the __________ inside the cell.

Two layers of phospholipid molecules make up most of the cell membrane in the cells of living things. Figure 9.22 shows how phospholipid molecules are arranged in a cell membrane. One end (the head) of each phospholipid molecule is polar and attracts water. This end is called hydrophilic (""water loving""). The other end (the tail) is nonpolar and repels water. This end is called hydrophobic (""water hating""). The nonpolar tails are on the inside of the membrane. The polar heads are on the outside of the membrane.

In addition, it must be possible to show that the hypothesis is false if it really is false. Consider this statement: There are other planets in the universe where life exists. This statement is testable. If it is true, it is at least theoretically possible to find evidence showing that its true. For example, a spacecraft could be sent from Earth to explore the universe and report back if it discovers an inhabited planet. If such a planet were found, it would prove the statement is true. However, the statement isnt a scientific hypothesis. Why? If it is false, its not possible to show that its false. The spacecraft may never find an inhabited planet, but that doesnt necessarily mean there isnt one. Given the vastness of the universe, we would never be able to check every planet for life!

1613,"Context: Youve probably blown soap bubbles like the child in Figure 4.1. In some ways, the thin film of soap molecules that forms a bubble resembles the cell membrane. Like the soap film, the cell membrane consists of a thin skin of molecules. You can see a model of the cell membrane in Figure below. The molecules that make up the cell membrane are mainly phospholipids. There are two layers of phospholipids. They are arranged so the lipid tails are on the inside of the membrane. They make the interior of the membrane hydrophobic, or ""water fearing"". The lipid heads point toward the outside of the membrane. The make the outer surfaces of the membrane hydrophilic, or ""water loving"". Different types of proteins are embedded in the lipid layers. The proteins are needed to help transport many substances across the membrane. The passage of a substance through a cell membrane is called transport.

1614,"Context: Some lipids contain the element phosphorus as well as carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. These lipids are called phospholipids. Two layers of phospholipid molecules make up the cell membranes of living things. In the Figure One end of each phospholipid molecule is polar, so it has a partial electric charge. Water is also polar and has electrically charged ends, so it is attracted to the oppositely charged end of a phospholipid molecule. This end of the phospholipid molecule is described as hydrophilic, which means water loving. The other end of each phospholipid molecule is nonpolar and has no electric charge. This end of the phospho- lipid molecule repels polar water and is described as hydrophobic, or water hating. In the Figure 1.3, the hydrophilic ends of the phospholipid molecules are on the outsides of the cell membrane, and the hydrophobic ends are on the inside of the cell membrane. This arrangement of phospholipids allows some substances to pass through the cell membrane while keeping other substances out.

1616,"Context: Hydrophilic molecules and very large molecules cant pass through the cell membrane by simple diffusion. They need help to pass through the membrane. The help is provided by proteins called transport proteins. This process is known as facilitated diffusion. There are two types of transport proteins: channel proteins and carrier proteins. They work in different ways. You can see how they work in Figure 4.3. A channel protein forms a tiny hole called a pore in the cell membrane. This allows water or hydrophilic molecules to bypass the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. A carrier protein binds with a diffusing molecule. This causes the carrier protein to change shape. As it does, it carries the molecule across the membrane. This allows large molecules to pass through the cell membrane.

1618,"Context: The cell membrane is semipermeable, or selectively permeable, which means that only some molecules can pass through the membrane. If the cell membrane were completely permeable, the inside of the cell would be the same as the outside of the cell. It would be impossible for the cell to maintain homeostasis. Homeostasis means maintaining a stable internal environment. For example, if your body cells have a temperature of 98.6 F, and it is freezing outside, your cells will maintain homeostasis if the temperature of the cells stays the same and does not drop with the outside temperature. How does the cell ensure it is semipermeable? How does the cell control what molecules enter and leave the cell? The composition of the cell membrane helps to control what can pass through it. 
Question: one important feature of the semipermeable membrane is that
Options:(A) semipermeability keeps the cell intact (B) semipermeability helps the cell maintain homeostasis (C) semipermeability makes the Bilayer form (D) all of the above
Answer:",B
1619,"Context: When you are cold, what does your body do to keep warm? You shiver to warm up your body. When you are too warm, you sweat to release heat. When any living organism gets thrown off balance, its body or cells help it return to normal. In other words, living organisms have the ability to keep a stable internal environment. Maintaining a balance inside the body or cells of organisms is known as homeostasis. Like us, many animals have evolved behaviors that control their internal temperature. A lizard may stretch out on a sunny rock to increase its internal temperature, and a bird may fluff its feathers to stay warm ( Figure 1.5). A bird fluffs its feathers to stay warm and to maintain homeostasis. 
Question: maintaining a stable internal temperature is an example of homeostasis.
Options:(A) true (B) false

Answer:",A
1621,"Context: The organ systems of the body work together to carry out life processes and maintain homeostasis. The body is in homeostasis when its internal environment is kept more-or-less constant. For example, levels of sugar, carbon dioxide, and water in the blood must be kept within narrow ranges. This requires continuous adjustments. For example: After you eat and digest a sugary snack, the level of sugar in your blood quickly rises. In response, the endocrine system secretes the hormone insulin. Insulin helps cells absorb sugar from the blood. This causes the level of sugar in the blood to fall back to its normal level. When you work out on a hot day, you lose a lot of water through your skin in sweat. The level of water in the blood may fall too low. In response, the excretory system excretes less water in urine. Instead, the water is returned to the blood to keep water levels from falling lower. What happens if homeostasis is not maintained? Cells may not get everything they need, or toxic wastes may build up in the body. If homeostasis is not restored, it may cause illness or even death. 
Question: which of the following are examples of maintaining homeostasis?
Options:(A) A person sweats to retain heat (B) A bird fluffs its feathers to cool down (C) A lizard stretches out on a sunny rock to increase its internal temperature (D) All are examples of methods to maintain homeostasis

1622,"Context: Asexual reproduction is simpler than sexual reproduction. It involves just one parent. The offspring are genetically identical to each other and to the parent. All prokaryotes and some eukaryotes reproduce this way. There are several different methods of asexual reproduction. They include binary fission, fragmentation, and budding. 
Question: asexual reproduction
Options:(A) combining genetic information from two parents (B) results in identical copies of the parent (C) occurs in all species (D) does not occur in single-celled bacteria

1623,"Context: According to the cell theory, all organisms are made up of one or more cells. Cells are the sites where all life processes take place. Cells come only from pre-existing cells. New cells forms when existing cells divide. Most cells are too small to see without a microscope. If you were to look at a drop of your blood under a microscope, Figure 1.5 shows two types of cells you might see. You can learn more about cells and the cell theory in the chapter Cells and Their Structures.

Answer:",B
1624,"Context: Why do you eat everyday? To get energy. Energy is the ability to do work. Without energy, you could not do any ""work."" Though not doing any ""work"" may sound nice, the ""work"" fueled by energy includes everyday activities, such as walking, writing, and thinking. But you are not the only one who needs energy. In order to grow and reproduce and carry out the other process of life, all living organisms need energy. But where does this energy come from? The source of energy differs for each type of living thing. In your body, the source of energy is the food you eat. Here is how animals, plants, and fungi obtain their energy: All animals must eat in order to obtain energy. Animals also eat to obtain building materials. Animals eat plants and other animals. Plants dont eat. Instead, they use energy from the sun to make their ""food"" through the process of photosyn- thesis. Mushrooms and other fungi obtain energy from other organisms. Thats why you often see fungi growing on a fallen tree; the rotting tree is their source of energy ( Figure 1.1). Since plants harvest energy from the sun and other organisms get their energy from plants, nearly all the energy of living things initially comes from the sun. Orange bracket fungi on a rotting log in the Oak Openings Preserve in Ohio. Fungi obtain energy from breaking down dead organisms, such as this rotting log.

1627,"Context: Mammals have also played a significant role in different cultures folklore and religion. For example, the grace and power of the cougar have been admired in the cultures of the native peoples of the Americas. The Inca city of Cuzco is designed in the shape of a cougar, and the thunder god of the Inca, Viracocha, has been associated with the animal. In North America, mythological descriptions of the cougar have appeared in the stories of several American Indian tribes. Important mammals include Dolly the sheep, Lassie the dog, and flipper the dolphin. Dolly was the first mammal to be cloned from an adult somatic (body) cell, using the process of nuclear transfer. Lassie was a collie dog who appeared in seven full length feature films in the 1940s and 1950s, starting with Lassie Come Home in 1943. Additional Lassie movies were made as recently as 2005. Between 1954 and 1973, the Lassie television series aired, with plenty of additional productions as recently as 2007. Flipper was a bottle nose dolphin that starred in a television series between 1964 and 1967. The most famous mammal may be King Kong, the giant gorilla that terrorized New York City in 1933 in the movie of the same name.

1628,"Context: The following is an analysis of the statements above: 1. This is a fact made from observation. 2. The first part is from observations. The second is a fact drawn from the prior observations. The third is an opinion, since she might actually have allergies or the flu. Tests could be done to see what is causing her illness. 3. This is a fact. Many, many scientific experiments have shown that colds are caused by viruses. 4. While that sounds like a fact, the scientific evidence is mixed. One reputable study published in 2007 showed a decrease of 58%, but several other studies have shown no beneficial effect. 5. Bill Gates is the wealthiest man in the United States; thats a fact. But theres no evidence that hes also the smartest man, and chances are hes not. This is an opinion. 6. This sounds like a fact, but it is not. It is easy to test. Gather together a large number of subjects, each with a friend. Have the friends fill out a questionnaire describing the subject. Match the traits against the persons astrological sign to see if the astrological predictions fit. Are Leos actually more fiery, self assured, and charming? Tests like this have not supported the claims of astrologers, yet astrologers have not modified their opinions. 7. This is a fact. The Figure 1.2 shows the temperature anomaly since 1880. Theres no doubt that temperature has risen overall since 1880 and especially since the late 1970s. Global Average Annual Temperatures are Rising. This graph shows temperature anomaly relative to the 1951-1980 aver- age (the average is made to be 0). The green bars show uncertainty.

1629,"Context: The zygote spends the next few days traveling down the fallopian tube toward the uterus, where it will take up residence. As it travels, it divides many times by mitosis. It soon forms a tiny, fluid-filled ball of cells called a blastocyst. The blastocyst has an inner and outer layer of cells, as you can see in Figure 22.5. The inner layer, called the embryoblast, will develop into the new human being. The outer layer, called the trophoblast, will develop into other structures needed to support the new organism. 
Question: which best defines a zygote?

1630,"Context: Cloning is the process of creating an exact genetic replica of an organism. The clones DNA is exactly the same as the parents DNA. Bacteria and other single-celled organisms have long been able to clone themselves through asexual reproduction. Plants can also reproduce asexually. In animals, however, cloning does not happen naturally. In 1997, that all changed when a sheep named Dolly was the first large mammal ever to be successfully cloned. Other animals can now also be cloned in a laboratory. The process of producing an animal like Dolly starts with a single cell from the animal that is going to be cloned. Below are the steps involved in the process of cloning: 1. In the case of Dolly, cells from the mammary glands were taken from the adult that was to be cloned. But other somatic cells can be used. Somatic cells come from the body and are not gametes like sperm or egg. 2. The nucleus is removed from this cell. 3. The nucleus is placed in a donor egg that has had its nucleus removed. The nucleus must be removed from the donor egg to maintain the appropriate chromosome number. 4. The new cell is stimulated with an electric shock and embryo development begins, as if it were a normal zygote. The zygote is the first cell of a new organism. 5. The resulting embryo is implanted into a mother sheep, where it continue its development ( Figure 1.1). To clone an animal, a nucleus from the animals cells are fused with an egg cell (from which the nucleus has been re- moved) from a donor, creating a new zy- gote. 
Question: why must the nucleus be removed from the donor egg cell during the cloning process?
Options:(A) So the zygote does not have too many chromosomes (B) To keep the number of human chromosomes at 46 (C) So the initial cell acts as a true zygote (D) All of the above are valid reasons

1634,"Context: Red blood cells (RBCs) are flattened, disk-shaped cells that carry oxygen. They are the most common blood cell in the blood. There are about 4 to 6 million RBCs per cubic millimeter of blood. Each RBC has about 200 million molecules of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein that carries oxygen. Hemoglobin also gives the red blood cells their red color. Red blood cells ( Figure 1.2) are made in the red marrow of long bones, rib bones, the skull, and vertebrae. Each red blood cell lives for only 120 days (about four months). After this time, they are destroyed in the liver and spleen. Mature red blood cells do not have a nucleus or other organelles. Lacking these components allows the cells to have more hemoglobin and carry more oxygen. The flattened shape of red blood cells helps them carry more oxygen than if they were rounded.

1635,"Context: Youre probably less familiar with plasmas than with solids, liquids, and gases. Yet, most of the universe consists of plasma. Plasma is a state of matter that resembles a gas but has certain properties that a gas does not have. Like a gas, plasma lacks a fixed volume and shape. Unlike a gas, plasma can conduct electricity and respond to magnetism. Thats because plasma contains charged particles called ions. This gives plasma other interesting properties. For example, it glows with light. Where can you find plasmas? Two examples are shown in Figure 4.7. The sun and other stars consist of plasma. Plasmas are also found naturally in lightning and the polar auroras (northern and southern lights). Artificial plasmas are found in fluorescent lights, plasma TV screens, and plasma balls like the one that opened this chapter. You can learn more about plasmas at this URL:  (2:58).

1636,"Context: What do these white blood cells do at the site of inflammation? The main role of white blood cells is to fight pathogens in the body. There are actually several different kinds of white blood cells. Some white blood cells have very specific functions. They attack only certain pathogens. Other white blood cells attack any pathogen they find. These white blood cells travel to areas of the body that are inflamed. They are called phagocytes, which means eating cells. Neutrophils are a type of phagocyte. In addition to pathogens, phagocytes eat dead cells. They surround the pathogens and destroy them. Sometimes it is said that the phagocyte engulfs the pathogen, and then destroys it. This process is called phagocytosis. White blood cells also make chemicals that cause a fever. A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6 F (37 C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells. In these ways, a fever helps the body fight infection. 
Question: which of the following are white blood cells that fight pathogens?
Options:(A) neutrophils (B) macrophages (C) lymphocytes (D) all of the above

1640,"Context: Small molecules can pass through the plasma membrane through a process called diffusion. Diffusion is the movement of molecules from an area where there is a higher concentration (larger amount) of the substance to an area where there is a lower concentration (lower amount) of the substance ( Figure 1.1). The amount of a substance in relation to the total volume is the concentration. During diffusion, molecules are said to flow down their concentration gradient, flowing from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. Molecules flowing down a concentration gradient is a natural process and does not require energy. Diffusion can occur across a semipermeable membrane, such as the cell membrane, as long as a concentration gradient exists. Molecules will continue to flow in this manner until equilibrium is reached. At equilibrium, there is no longer an area of high concentration or low concentration, and molecules flow equally in both directions across the semipermeable membrane. At equilibrium, equal amounts of a molecule are entering and leaving a cell. Diffusion is the movement of a substance from an area of a higher amount toward an area of lower amount. A concentra- tion gradient initially exists across the cell membrane. Equilibrium is reached when there is an equal amount of the substance on both sides of the membrane. 
Question: diffusion is the movement of molecules from an area of low amount to an area of high amount.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
1641,"Context: Passive transport occurs when a substance passes through the cell membrane without needing any energy to pass through. This happens when a substance moves from an area where it is more concentrated to an area where it is less concentrated. Concentration is the number of particles of a substance in a given volume. Lets say you dissolve a teaspoon of salt in a cup of water. Then you dissolve two teaspoons of salt in another cup of water. The second solution will have a higher concentration of salt. Why does passive transport require no energy? A substance naturally moves from an area of higher to lower concentration. This is known as moving down the concentration gradient. The process is called diffusion. Its a little like a ball rolling down a hill. The ball naturally rolls from a higher to lower position without any added energy. You can see diffusion if you place a few drops of food coloring in a pan of water. Even without shaking or stirring, the food coloring gradually spreads throughout the water in the pan. Some substances can also diffuse through a cell membrane. This can occur in two ways: simple diffusion or facilitated diffusion. 
Question: diffusion does not require energy.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
1642,"Context: One example of passive transport is diffusion, when molecules move from an area of high concentration (large amount) to an area of low concentration (low amount). Molecules are said to naturally flow down their concentration gradient. This type of diffusion proceeds without an input of energy. In simple diffusion, molecules that are small and uncharged can freely diffuse across a cell membrane. They simply flow through the cell membrane. Simple diffusion does not require energy or need the assistance of a transport protein. Other larger or charged molecules that diffuse across a membrane may need assistance from a protein. Oxygen is a molecule that can freely diffuse across a cell membrane. For example, oxygen diffuses out of the air sacs in your lungs into your bloodstream because oxygen is more concentrated in your lungs than in your blood. Oxygen moves from the high concentration of oxygen in your lungs to the low concentration of oxygen in your bloodstream. Carbon dioxide, which is exhaled, moves in the opposite direction - from a high concentration in your bloodstream to a low concentration in your lungs. 
Question: during diffusion, which way to molecules move?
Options:(A) Molecules flow down the concentration gradient (B) Molecules flow against the concentration gradient (C) From an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration (D) none of the above
Answer:",A
1643,"Context: The diffusion of water across a membrane because of a difference in concentration is called osmosis. Lets explore three different situations and analyze the flow of water. 1. A hypotonic solution means the environment outside of the cell has a lower concentration of dissolved material than the inside of the cell. If a cell is placed in a hypotonic solution, water will move into the cell. This causes the cell to swell, and it may even burst. 2. A hypertonic solution means the environment outside of the cell has more dissolved material than inside of the cell. If a cell is placed in a hypertonic solution, water will leave the cell. This can cause a cell to shrink and shrivel. 3. An isotonic solution is a solution in which the amount of dissolved material is equal both inside and outside of the cell. Water still flows in both directions, but an equal amount enters and leaves the cell.

Answer:",C
1646,"Context: Simple diffusion occurs when a substance diffuses through a cell membrane without any help from other molecules. The substance simply passes through tiny spaces in the membrane. It moves from the side of the membrane where it is more concentrated to the side where it is less concentrated. You can see how this happens in Figure 4.2. Substances that cross cell membranes by simple diffusion must squeeze between the lipid molecules in the mem- brane. As a result, the diffusing molecules must be very small. Oxygen (O2 ) and carbon dioxide (CO2 ) are examples of molecules that can cross cell membranes this way. When you breathe in, oxygen is more concentrated in the air in your lungs than it is in your blood. So oxygen diffuses from your lungs to your blood. The reverse happens with carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is more concentrated in your blood than it is in the air in your lungs. So carbon dioxide diffuses out of your blood to your lungs.

Options:(A) a starch molecule (B) a protein (C) a sodium ion (D) DNA
Answer:",C
1647,"Context: DNA must replicate (copy) itself so that each resulting cell after mitosis and cell division has the same DNA as the parent cell. All these cells, the parent cell and the two new daughter cells, are genetically identical. DNA replication occurs during the S phase (the Synthesis phase) of the cell cycle, before mitosis and cell division. The base pairing rules are crucial for the process of replication. DNA replication occurs when DNA is copied to form an identical molecule of DNA. The general steps involved in DNA replication are as follows: 1. The DNA helix unwinds like a zipper as the bonds between the base pairs are broken. The enzyme DNA Helicase is involved in breaking these bonds. 2. The two single strands of DNA then each serve as a template for a new stand to be created. Using DNA as a template means that on the new strand, the bases are placed in the correct order because of the base pairing rules. Recall that A and T are complementary bases, as are G and C. As a template strand is read, the new strand is created. If ATGCCA is on the ""template strand,"" then TACGGT will be on the new DNA strand. The enzyme DNA Polymerase reads the template and builds the new strand of DNA. 3. The new set of nucleotides then join together to form a new strand of DNA. The process results in two DNA molecules, each with one old strand and one new strand of DNA. This process is known as semiconservative replication because one strand is conserved (kept the same) in each new DNA molecule ( Figure 1.1). DNA replication occurs when the DNA strands unzip, and the original strands of DNA serve as a template for new nucleotides to join and form a new strand. 
Question: dna is replicated in a semiconservative manner.

Using DNA as a template means that on the new strand, the bases are placed in the correct order because of the base pairing rules. Recall that A and T are complementary bases, as are G and C. As a template strand is read, the new strand is created. If ATGCCA is on the ""template strand,"" then TACGGT will be on the new DNA strand. The enzyme DNA Polymerase reads the template and builds the new strand of DNA. 3. The new set of nucleotides then join together to form a new strand of DNA. The process results in two DNA molecules, each with one old strand and one new strand of DNA. This process is known as semiconservative replication because one strand is conserved (kept the same) in each new DNA molecule ( Figure 1.1). DNA replication occurs when the DNA strands unzip, and the original strands of DNA serve as a template for new nucleotides to join and form a new strand.

1652,"Context: DNA is located in the nucleus. Proteins are made on ribosomes in the cytoplasm. Remember that information in a gene is converted into mRNA, which carries the information to the ribosome. In the nucleus, mRNA is created by using the DNA in a gene as a template. A template is a model provided for others to copy. The process of constructing an mRNA molecule from DNA is known as transcription ( Figure 1.1 and Figure of double stranded DNA. In transcription, only one strand of DNA is used as a template. First, the double helix of DNA unwinds and an enzyme, RNA Polymerase, builds the mRNA using the DNA as a template. The nucleotides follow basically the same base pairing rules as in DNA to form the correct sequence in the mRNA. This time, however, uracil (U) pairs with each adenine (A) in the DNA. For example, a DNA sequence ACGGGTAAGG will be transcribed into the mRNA sequence UGCCCAUUCC. In this manner, the information of the DNA is passed on to the mRNA. The mRNA will carry this code to the ribosomes to tell them how to make a protein. As not all genes are used in every cell, a gene must be ""turned on"" or expressed when the gene product is needed by the cell. Only the information in a gene that is being expressed is transcribed into an mRNA. Transcription is when RNA is created from a DNA template. Each gene (a) contains triplets of bases (b) that are transcribed into RNA (c). Every triplet in the DNA, or codon in the mRNA, encodes for a unique amino acid. Base-pairing ensures the accuracy of transcription. Notice how the helix must unwind for transcription to take place. The new mRNA is shown in green.

1658,"Context: The organisms pictured in the Figures 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 all use sunlight to make glucose in the process of photo- synthesis. In addition to plants, they include bacteria and algae. All of these organisms contain the green pigment chlorophyll, which is needed to capture light energy. A tremendous amount of photosynthesis takes place in the plants of this lush tropi- cal rainforest. 
Question: which of the following capture energy by photosynthesis?
Options:(A) a maple tree (B) a Portobello mushroom (C) a blue whale (D) all of the above
Answer:",A
1659,"Context: Recall that producers make their own food through photosynthesis. But many organisms are not producers and cannot make their own food. So how do these organisms obtain their energy? They must get their energy from other organisms. They must eat other organisms, or obtain their energy from these organisms some other way. The organisms that obtain their energy from other organisms are called consumers. All animals are consumers, and they eat other organisms. Fungi and many protists and bacteria are also consumers. But, whereas animals eat other organisms, fungi, protists, and bacteria ""consume"" organisms through different methods. The consumers can be placed into different groups, depending on what they consume. Herbivores are animals that eat producers to get energy. For example, rabbits and deer are herbivores that eat plants. The caterpillar pictured below ( Figure 1.1) is a herbivore. Animals that eat phytoplankton in aquatic environments are also herbivores. Carnivores feed on animals, either herbivores or other carnivores. Snakes that eat mice are carnivores. Hawks that eat snakes are also carnivores ( Figure 1.1). Omnivores eat both producers and consumers. Most people are omnivores, since they eat fruits, vegetables, and grains from plants, and also meat and dairy products from animals. Dogs, bears, and raccoons are also omnivores. Examples of consumers are caterpillars (herbivores) and hawks (carnivore).

1660,"Context: The Archaea and Bacteria domains ( Figure 1.1) are both entirely composed of small, single-celled organisms and seem very similar, but they also have significant differences. Both are composed of prokaryotic cells, which are cells without a nucleus. In addition, both domains are composed of species that reproduce asexually ( asexual reproduction) by dividing in two. Both domains also have species with cells surrounded by a cell wall, however, the cell walls are made of different materials. Bacterial cell walls contain the polysaccharide peptidoglycan. Lastly, Archaea often live in extreme environments including hot springs, geysers, and salt flats. Bacteria do not live in these environments.

1663,"Context: Egg production takes place in the ovaries. It occurs in several steps: 1. Before birth, special cells in the ovaries go through mitosis to make identical daughter cells. 2. The daughter cells then start to divide by meiosis. However, they go though only the first of the two cell divisions of meiosis at this time. They remain in that stage until the girl goes through puberty. 3. After puberty, an egg develops in an ovary about once a month. As you can see in Figure 22.4, the egg rests in a nest of cells called a follicle. The follicle and egg grow larger and go through other changes. 4. After a couple of weeks, the egg bursts out of the follicle and through the wall of the ovary. This is called ovulation. After ovulation occurs, the moving fingers of the nearby fallopian tube sweep the egg into the tube. Fertilization may occur if sperm reach the egg while it is passing through the fallopian tube. If this happens, the egg finally completes meiosis. This results in two daughter cells that differ in size. The smaller cell is called a polar body. It soon breaks down and disappears. The larger cell is the fertilized egg, which will develop into a new human being.

1668,"Context: Almost all fungi can reproduce sexually. But why reproduce sexually when asexual reproduction is much quicker? Sexual reproduction brings together traits from the two parents. This increases the genetic diversity of the species. In plants and animals, sexual reproduction occurs when sperm and egg from two parents join to make a new individual. In fungi, however, two haploid hyphae meet together and their nuclei fuse. Instead of calling a hyphae male or female, they have different mating types, such as (+) and (-) ( Figure 1.2). The common mushroom, a fruiting body, results after sexual reproduction when two hyphae, one (+) and one (-), mate, forming a mycelium with sporangia. No- tice, when the sporangia burst, the spores are released from the fruiting body. 
Question: a mushroom has the reproductive parts of the fungus.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
1669,"Context: The most important body parts of fungi include: 1. Cell wall: A layer around the cell membrane of fungi cells made largely of chitin and other polysaccharides. It is similar to that found in plant cells, though the plant cell wall contains the polysaccharide cellulose. 2. Hyphae: These are thread-like strands which interconnect and bunch up into a mycelium ( Figure 1.1). Ever see mold on a damp wall or on old bread? The things that you are seeing are really mycelia. The hyphae and mycelia help the fungi absorb nutrients from other organisms. Most of the mycelium is hidden from view deep within the fungal food source, such as rotting matter in the soil, leaf litter, rotting wood, or dead animals. Fungi produce enzymes to digest cellulose and various other materials found in rotting matter, helping with the decaying process. 3. Specialized structures for reproduction: One example is a fruiting body. Just like a fruit is involved in the reproduction of a fruiting plant, a fruiting body is involved in the reproduction of a fungus. A mushroom is a fruiting body, which is the part of the fungus that produces spores ( Figure 1.2). The spores are the basic reproductive units of fungi. The mycelium remains hidden until it develops one or more fruiting bodies. The fruiting bodies are usually produced at the surface of the food source, rather than hidden within it. This allows the reproductive spores to be easily shed and carried away by the wind, water, or animals. The fruiting bodies are usually the only indication that a fungus is present. Like icebergs, the fruiting bodies represent only a tiny fraction of the whole fungus, with most of the fungus hidden from view. Hyphae of a Penicillium mold.

Options:(A) hyphae (B) mycelia (C) cell wall (D) fruiting body
Answer:",D
1672,"Context: Most fungi reproduce both asexually and sexually. In both types of reproduction, they produce spores. A spore is a special reproductive cell. When fungi reproduce asexually, they can spread quickly. This is good when conditions are stable. They can increase their genetic variation by sexual reproduction. This is beneficial when conditions are changing. Variation helps ensure that at least some organisms survive the changing conditions. Figure 9.10 shows how asexual and sexual reproduction occur in fungi. Refer to the figure as you read about each of them below.

1675,"Context: Fungus-like protists share many features with fungi. Like fungi, they are heterotrophs, meaning they must obtain food outside themselves. They also have cell walls and reproduce by forming spores, just like fungi. Fungus-like protists usually do not move, but a few develop movement at some point in their lives. Two major types of fungus- like protists are slime molds and water molds. 
Question: like all fungi, fungi-like protists are autotrophs.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
1676,"Context: There are many different types of animal-like protists. They are different because they move in different ways. Flagellates have long flagella, or tails. Flagella rotate in a propeller-like fashion, pushing the protist through its environment ( Figure 1.1). An example of a flagellate is Trypanosoma, which causes African sleeping sickness. Other protists have what are called transient pseudopodia, which are like temporary feet. The cell surface extends out to form feet-like structures that propel the cell forward. An example of a protist with pseudopodia is the amoeba. The ciliates are protists that move by using cilia. Cilia are thin, very small tail-like projections that extend outward from the cell body. Cilia beat back and forth, moving the protist along. Paramecium has cilia that propel it. The sporozoans are protists that produce spores, such as the toxoplasma. These protists do not move at all. The spores develop into new protists. These flagellates all cause diseases in humans. A video of the animal-like amoeba can be viewed at: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Amoeba_engulfing_

Answer:",B
1677,"Context: Fungus-like protists share many features with fungi. Like fungi, they are heterotrophs, meaning they must obtain food outside themselves. They also have cell walls and reproduce by forming spores, just like fungi. Fungus-like protists usually do not move, but a few develop movement at some point in their lives. Two major types of fungus- like protists are slime molds and water molds. 
Question: which of the following is a characteristic of fungi-like protists?
Options:(A) have cell walls (B) can photosynthesize (C) commonly form relationships beneficial to both organisms (D) All of the above are characteristics of fungi-like protists
Answer:",A
1678,"Context: Water molds mostly live in water or moist soil. They can be parasites of plants and animals, getting their nutrients from these organisms and also from decaying organisms. They are a common problem for farmers since they cause a variety of plant diseases. One of the most famous of these diseases was the fungus that caused the Irish potato famine in the 1800s. At this time, potatoes were the main source of food for many of the Irish people. The failure of the potato crop meant that many people in Ireland died of starvation or migrated to other countries. 
Question: what type of mold caused the irish potato famine?
Options:(A) a slime mole (B) a water mold (C) a potato mold (D) the Irish mold
Answer:",B
1679,"Context: Slime molds usually measure about one or two centimeters, but a few slime molds are as big as several meters. They often have bright colors, such as a vibrant yellow ( Figure 1.1). Others are brown or white. Stemonitis is a kind of slime mold which forms small brown bunches on the outside of rotting logs. Physarum polycephalum lives inside rotting logs and is a gooey mesh of yellow ""threads"" that are several centimeters long. Fuligo, sometimes called vomit mold, is a yellow slime mold found in decaying wood. An example of a slime mold.

1682,"Context: During in vivo gene therapy, done inside the body, the vector with the gene of interest is introduced directly into the patient and taken up by the patients cells ( Figure 1.1). For example, cystic fibrosis gene therapy is targeted at the respiratory system, so a solution with the vector can be sprayed into the patients nose. Recently, in vivo gene therapy was also used to partially restore the vision of three young adults with a rare type of eye disease. In ex vivo gene therapy, done outside the body, cells are removed from the patient and the proper gene is inserted using a virus as a vector. The modified cells are placed back into the patient. One of the first uses of this type of gene therapy was in the treatment of a young girl with a rare genetic disease, adenosine deaminase deficiency, or ADA deficiency. People with this disorder are missing the ADA enzyme, which breaks down a toxin called deoxyadenosine. If the toxin is not broken down, it accumulates and destroys immune cells. As a result, individuals with ADA deficiency do not have a healthy immune system to fight off infections. In the gene therapy treatment for this disorder, bone marrow stem cells were taken from the girls body, and the missing gene was inserted into these cells outside the body. Then the modified cells were put back into her bloodstream. This treatment successfully restored the function of her immune system, but only with repeated treatments.

1689,"Context: Eggs are very big cells. In fact, they are the biggest cells in the human female body. (How many egg cells are in the human male body?) An egg is about 30 times as wide as a sperm cell! You can even see an egg cell without a microscope. Like a sperm cell, the egg contains a nucleus with half the number of chromosomes as other body cells. Unlike a sperm cell, the egg contains a lot of cytoplasm, the contents of the cell, which is why it is so big. The egg also does not have a tail. 
Question: eggs are the biggest cells in the female and male body.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
1690,"Context: Egg production takes place in the ovaries. It takes several steps to make an egg: 1. Before birth, special cells in the ovaries go through mitosis (cell division), producing identical cells. 2. The daughter cells then start to divide by meiosis. But they only go through the first of the two cell divisions of meiosis at that time. They go through the second stage of cell division after the female goes through puberty. 3. In a mature female, an egg develops in an ovary about once a month. The drawing below shows how this happens ( Figure 1.1). As you can see from the figure, the egg rests in a nest of cells called a follicle. The follicle and egg grow larger and go through other changes. The follicle protects the egg as it matures in the ovary. After a couple of weeks, the egg bursts out of the follicle and through the wall of the ovary. This is called ovulation, which usually occurs at the midpoint of a monthly cycle. In a 28 day cycle, ovulation would occur around day 14. The moving fingers of the nearby fallopian tube then sweep the egg into the tube. At this time, if sperm are present the egg can be fertilized. Fertilization occurs if a sperm enters the egg while it is passing through the fallopian tube. When this happens, the egg finally completes meiosis. This results in two daughter cells that are different in size. The smaller cell is called a polar body. It contains very little cytoplasm. It soon breaks down and disappears. The larger cell is the egg. It contains most of the cytoplasm. This will develop into a child. 
Question: the follicle protects the egg while it matures in the fallopian tube.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
1691,"Context: The menstrual cycle is a series of changes in the reproductive system of mature females that repeats every month. While the egg and follicle are developing in the ovary, tissues are building up inside the uterus, the reproductive organ where the baby would develop. The uterus develops a thick lining covered in tiny blood vessels. This prepares the uterus to receive an egg that could develop into a child (a fertilized egg). The occurs during the first part of the cycle. Ovulation, the release of an egg from the ovary, occurs at about the midpoint of the cycle. This would be around day 14 of a 28 day cycle. The egg is swept into the fallopian tube. If sperm is present, fertilization may occur. As sperm can only survive in the fallopian tube for up to a few days, fertilization can only occur within those few days post-ovulation. If the egg is fertilized, the egg makes its way through the fallopian tube into the uterus, where it imbeds into the thick lining. When this occurs, the monthly cycle stops. The monthly cycle does not resume until the pregnancy is over. If a sperm does not enter an egg, the lining of the uterus breaks down. Blood and other tissues from the lining break off from the uterus. They pass through the vagina and out of the body. This is called menstruation. Menstruation is also called a menstrual period. It lasts about 4 days, on average. When the menstrual period ends, the cycle repeats. Some women feel discomfort during this process. Some people think that the average length of a menstrual period is the same as the normal length. They assume that shorter or longer menstrual periods are not normal. In fact, menstrual periods can vary from 1 to 8 days in length. This is usually normal. The average length of the cycle (time between menstrual periods) is about 28 days, but there is no normal cycle length. Some women experience cramping and pain before and during menstruation.

1695,"Context: In species with sexual reproduction, each cell of the body has two copies of each chromosome. For example, human beings have 23 different chromosomes. Each body cell contains two of each chromosome, for a total of 46 chromosomes. You can see the 23 pairs of human chromosomes in Figure 5.13. The number of different types of chromosomes is called the haploid number. In humans, the haploid number is 23. The number of chromosomes in normal body cells is called the diploid number. The diploid number is twice the haploid number. In humans, the diploid number is two times 23, or 46.

1697,"Context: It takes up to two months for mature sperm to form. The process occurs in several steps: 1. Special cells in the testes go through mitosis to make identical copies of themselves. 2. The copies of the original cells divide by meiosis. This results in haploid cells called spermatids. These cells lack tails and cannot yet swim. 3. Spermatids move from the testes to the epididymis, where they slowly mature. For example, they grow a tail and lose some of the cytoplasm from the head. 4. Once sperm are mature, they can swim. The mature sperm remain in the epididymis until it is time for them to leave the body. Sperm leave the epididymis through the vas deferens. As they travel through the vas deferens, they pass by the prostate and other glands. The sperm mix with secretions from these glands, forming semen. Semen travels through the urethra and leaves the body through the penis. A teaspoon of semen may contain as many as half a billion sperm!

1703,"Context: Most B cells and T cells die after an infection has been brought under control. But some of them survive for many years. They may even survive for a persons lifetime. These long-lasting B and T cells are called memory cells Memory cells allow the immune system to remember a pathogen after the infection is over. If the pathogen invades the body again, the memory cells will start dividing in order to fight it. They will quickly produce a new army of B or T cells to fight the pathogen. They will begin a faster, stronger attack than the first time the pathogen invaded the body. As a result, the immune system will be able to destroy the pathogen before it can cause an infection. Being able to fight off and resist a pathogen in this way is called immunity. You dont have to suffer through an infection to gain immunity to some diseases. Immunity can also come about by vaccination. Vaccination is the process of exposing a person to pathogens on purpose so the person will develop immunity to them. In vaccination, the pathogens are usually injected under the skin. Only part of the pathogens are injected, or else weakened or dead pathogens are used. This causes an immune response without causing the disease. Diseases you are likely to have been vaccinated against include measles, mumps, and chicken pox.

Answer:",A
1704,"Context: Getting the recommended vaccinations can help prevent diseases, such as whooping cough and flu. In fact, a yearly flu vaccine is recommended for everyone who is at least 6 months of age. The flu vaccine is especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications (like pneumonia) if they get sick with the flu. People who have certain medical conditions including asthma, diabetes, and chronic lung disease, pregnant women, and people younger than 5 years (and especially those younger than 2), and people 65 years and older should also make sure they get the yearly flu vaccine. Seeking medical help for diseases like asthma can help stop the disease from getting worse. If you are unsure if you should go to the doctor, call the doctors office and ask.

Most B and T cells die after an infection has been brought under control. But some of them survive for many years. They may even survive for a persons lifetime. These long-lasting B and T cells are called memory cells. They allow the immune system to remember the pathogen after the infection is over. If the pathogen invades the body again, the memory cells will start dividing in order to fight the pathogen or disease. These dividing cells will quickly produce a new army of B or T cells to fight the pathogen. They will begin a faster, stronger attack than the first time the pathogen invaded the body. As a result, the immune system will be able to destroy the pathogen before it can cause an infection. Being able to attack the pathogen in this way is called immunity. Immunity can also be caused by vaccination. Vaccination is the process of exposing a person to a pathogen on purpose in order to develop immunity. In vaccination, a modified pathogen is usually injected under the skin by a shot. Only part of the pathogen is injected, or a weak or dead pathogen is used. It sounds dangerous, but the shot prepares your body for fighting the pathogen without causing the actual illness. Vaccination triggers an immune response against the injected antigen. The body prepares ""memory"" cells for use at a later time, in case the antigen is ever encountered again. Essentially, a vaccine imitates an infection, triggering an immune response, without making a person sick. In many countries, children receive their first vaccination at birth with the Hepatitis B shot, which protects infants from Hepatitis B, a serious liver disease. Before vaccines, many children died from diseases that vaccines now prevent, such as whooping cough, measles, and polio. Those same germs exist today, but because babies are now protected by vaccines, we do not see these diseases nearly as often. Diseases you have probably been vaccinated against include measles, mumps, and chicken pox. How does a vaccine work? See How a Vaccine Works at  and The History of Vaccines at  .

Question: why do vaccinations not make you sick?
Options:(A) Because a weak or dead pathogen is used (B) Because medicine is used so you don’t get sick (C) Because the memory cells fight the pathogen (D) all of the above
Answer:",A
1707,"Context: Getting the recommended vaccinations can help prevent diseases, such as whooping cough and flu. In fact, a yearly flu vaccine is recommended for everyone who is at least 6 months of age. The flu vaccine is especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications (like pneumonia) if they get sick with the flu. People who have certain medical conditions including asthma, diabetes, and chronic lung disease, pregnant women, and people younger than 5 years (and especially those younger than 2), and people 65 years and older should also make sure they get the yearly flu vaccine. Seeking medical help for diseases like asthma can help stop the disease from getting worse. If you are unsure if you should go to the doctor, call the doctors office and ask.

1710,"Context: Some defenses, like your skin and mucous membranes, are not designed to ward off a specific pathogen. They are just general defenders against disease. Your body also has defenses that are more specialized. Through the help of your immune system, your body can generate an army of cells to kill that one specific pathogen. There are two different types of specific immune responses. One type involves B cells. The other type involves T cells. Recall that B cells and T cells are types of white blood cells that are key in the immune response. Whereas the immune systems first and second line of defense are more generalized or non-specific, the immune response is specific. It can be described as a specific response to a specific pathogen, meaning it uses methods to target just one pathogen at a time. These methods involve B and T cells. 
Question: the second line of defense is specific to a few types of pathogens.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
1711,"Context: The bodys second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. This little girl just got her first scraped knee. It doesnt seem to hurt, but the break in her skin could let pathogens enter her body. Thats why scrapes should be kept clean and protected until they heal. 
Question: inflammation begins when the skin or other tissues is damaged or cut.

Answer:",A
1712,"Context: If bacteria enter the skin through a splinter or other wound, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. It occurs due to chemicals that are released when tissue is damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, increasing blood flow to the area. The chemicals also attract white blood cells to the area. The white blood cells leak out of the blood vessels and into the damaged tissue.

Question: the dilation of blood vessels during the inflammatory response
Options:(A) increases blood flow to the damaged area (B) allows the damaged skin to clot and stop bleeding (C) allows the mucous membranes to heal the wound (D) all of the above
Answer:",A
1713,"Context: What do these white blood cells do at the site of inflammation? The main role of white blood cells is to fight pathogens in the body. There are actually several different kinds of white blood cells. Some white blood cells have very specific functions. They attack only certain pathogens. Other white blood cells attack any pathogen they find. These white blood cells travel to areas of the body that are inflamed. They are called phagocytes, which means eating cells. Neutrophils are a type of phagocyte. In addition to pathogens, phagocytes eat dead cells. They surround the pathogens and destroy them. Sometimes it is said that the phagocyte engulfs the pathogen, and then destroys it. This process is called phagocytosis. White blood cells also make chemicals that cause a fever. A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6 F (37 C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells. In these ways, a fever helps the body fight infection. 
Question: what is the main role of white blood cells?
Options:(A) to transport oxygen around the body (B) to warm damaged blood vessels so they can heal (C) to fight pathogens (D) to raise the temperature of the body
Answer:",C
1714,"Context: Phagocytes also release chemicals that cause a fever. A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6 F (37 C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce quickly at this temperature. When the temperature rises higher, the pathogens cant reproduce as quickly. Therefore, a fever helps to limit the infection. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells to fight the infection. 
Question: why does temperature increase as part of the second line of defense?
Options:(A) Damaged blood vessels heal faster at higher temperatures (B) Pathogens do not reproduce as well at higher temperatures (C) Phagocytes destroy pathogens faster at higher temperatures (D) all of the above
Answer:",B
1715,"Context: The white blood cells that go to a site of inflammation and leak into damaged tissue are called phagocytes. They start eating pathogens and dead cells by engulfing and destroying them. This process is called phagocytosis. You can see how it happens in Figure ??. You can see it in action in the animation at this link: http://commons.wikim 
Question: how do white blood cells get to site of inflammation?
Options:(A) They actually leak out of blood vessels into damaged areas (B) Blood vessels have many entry and exit valves (C) where the white blood cells can easily enter and leave the vessels (D) c The damaged tissue makes them (E) so they are already at the site of inflammation (F) d They only function inside damaged blood vessels

Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
1718,"Context: B cells respond to pathogens and other cells from outside the body in the blood and lymph. Most B cells fight infections by making antibodies. An antibody is a large, Y-shaped protein that binds to an antigen, a protein that is recognized as foreign. Antigens are found on the outside of bacteria, viruses and other foreign microorganisms. Each antibody can bind with just one specific type of antigen ( Figure 1.1). They fit together like a lock and key. Once an antigen and antibody bind together, they signal for a phagocyte to destroy them. Phagocytes are white blood cells that engulf targeted antigens by phagocytosis. As the antigen is on the outside of a pathogen, the pathogen is destroyed by this process. At any one time the average human body contains antibodies that can react with about 100,000,000 different antigens. This means that there can be 100,000,000 different antibody proteins in the body. 
Question: the immune response is activated by a foreign antigen.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
1719,"Context: Immune system organs include bone marrow, the thymus gland, the spleen, and the tonsils. Each organ has a different job in the immune system. Bone marrow is found inside many bones. Its role in the immune system is to produce white blood cells called lymphocytes. The thymus gland is in the chest behind the breast bone. It stores some types of lymphocytes while they mature. The spleen is in the abdomen below the lungs. Its job is to filter pathogens out of the blood. The two tonsils are located on either side of the throat. They trap pathogens that enter the body through the mouth or nose. 
Question: what organ is involved in the immune response?
Options:(A) the spleen (B) the thymus gland (C) the tonsils (D) all of the above
Answer:",D
1720,"Context: There are two different types of immune responses. Both types involve lymphocytes. However, one type of response involves B cells. The other type involves T cells. 
Question: what are the two main types of lymphocytes?
Options:(A) A cells and B cells (B) B cells and T cells (C) neutrophils and phagocytes (D) white blood cells and phagocytes
Answer:",B
1721,"Context: A lymphocyte is the type of white blood cell involved in an immune system response. You can see what a lymphocyte looks like, greatly magnified, in Figure 21.15. Lymphocytes make up about one quarter of all white blood cells, but there are trillions of them in the human body. Usually, fewer than half of the bodys lymphocytes are in the blood. The majority are in the lymph, lymph nodes, and lymph organs. There are two main types of lymphocytes, called B cells and T cells. Both types of lymphocytes are produced in bone marrow. They are named for the sites where they grow and mature. The B in B cells stands for bone marrow, where B cells mature. The T in T cells stands for thymus gland, where T cells mature. Both B cells and T cells must be switched on in order to fight a specific pathogen. Once this happens, they produce an army of cells that are ready to fight that particular pathogen. How can B and T cells recognize specific pathogens? Pathogens have unique antigens, often located on their cell surface. Antigens are proteins that the body recognizes either as self or nonself. Self antigens include those found on red blood cells that determine a persons blood type. Generally, the immune system doesnt respond to self antigens. Nonself antigens include those found on bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. Nonself antigens are also found on other cells, such as pollen cells and cancer cells. It is these antigens that trigger an immune response. 
Question: what turns on a lymphocyte?

Answer:",C
1722,"Context: Lymphocytes ( Figure 1.3), a type of white blood cell, are the key cells of an immune response. There are trillions of lymphocytes in the human body. They make up about one quarter of all white blood cells. Usually, fewer than half of the bodys lymphocytes are in the blood. The rest are in the lymph, lymph nodes, and lymph organs. There are two main types of lymphocytes: 1. B cells. This image of a lymphocyte was made with an electron microscope. The lym- phocyte is shown 10,000 times its actual size. 2. T cells. Both types of lymphocytes are produced in the red bone marrow. They are named for the sites where they grow larger. The ""B"" in B cells stands for bone. B cells grow larger in red bone marrow. The ""T"" in T cells stands for thymus. T cells mature in the thymus gland. B and T cells must be switched on in order to fight a specific pathogen. Once this happens, they produce an army of cells ready to fight that particular pathogen. How can B and T cells recognize specific pathogens? Pathogens have proteins, often located on their cell surface. These proteins are called antigens. An antigen is any protein that causes an immune response, because it is unlike any protein that the body makes. Antigens are found on bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. Your body sees these as foreign, meaning they do not belong in your body.

1723,"Context: Most body fluids that you release from your body contain chemicals that kill pathogens. For example, mucus, sweat, tears, and saliva contain enzymes called lysozymes that kill pathogens. These enzymes can break down the cell walls of bacteria to kill them. The stomach also releases a very strong acid, called hydrochloric acid. This acid kills most pathogens that enter the stomach in food or water. Urine is also acidic, so few pathogens can grow in it. This is what the cilia lining the lungs look like when they are magnified. Their movements constantly sweep mucus and pathogens out of the lungs. Do they remind you of brushes? 
Question: what traps pathogens in the back of the throat so they do not enter farther into the body?

Answer:",B
1724,"Context: In species with sexual reproduction, each cell of the body has two copies of each chromosome. For example, human beings have 23 different chromosomes. Each body cell contains two of each chromosome, for a total of 46 chromosomes. You can see the 23 pairs of human chromosomes in Figure 5.13. The number of different types of chromosomes is called the haploid number. In humans, the haploid number is 23. The number of chromosomes in normal body cells is called the diploid number. The diploid number is twice the haploid number. In humans, the diploid number is two times 23, or 46. 
Question: a normal human body cell has 46 chromosomes.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
1725,"Context: Today we know that the traits of organisms are controlled by genes on chromosomes. A gene can be defined as a section of a chromosome that contains the genetic code for a particular protein. The position of a gene on a chromosome is called its locus. Each gene may have different versions. The different versions are called alleles. Figure 6.6 shows an example in pea plants. It shows the gene for flower color. The gene has two alleles. There is a purple-flower allele and a white-flower allele. Different alleles account for most of the variation in the traits of organisms within a species. In sexually reproducing species, chromosomes are present in cells in pairs. Chromosomes in the same pair are called homologous chromosomes. They have the same genes at the same loci. These may be the same or different alleles. During meiosis, when gametes are produced, homologous chromosomes separate. They go to different gametes. Thus, the alleles for each gene also go to different gametes. 
Question: homologous chromosomes have different alleles of the same genes.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
1726,"Context: During meiosis II, the sister chromatids are separated and the gametes are generated. This cell division is similar to that of mitosis, but results in four genetically unique haploid cells. The steps are outlined below: 1. Prophase II: The chromosomes condense. 2. Metaphase II: The chromosomes line up one on top of each other along the middle of the cell, similar to how they line up in mitosis. The spindle is attached to the centromere of each chromosome. 3. Anaphase II: The sister chromatids separate as the spindle shortens and move to opposite ends of the cell. 4. Telophase II: A nuclear envelope forms around the chromosomes in all four cells. This is followed by cytokinesis. After cytokinesis, each cell has divided again. Therefore, meiosis results in four haploid genetically unique daughter cells, each with half the DNA of the parent cell ( Figure 1.3). In human cells, the parent cell has 46 chromosomes (23 pairs), so the cells produced by meiosis have 23 chromosomes. These cells will become gametes. 
Question: what is the product of meiosis?
Options:(A) two haploid cells (B) two diploid cells (C) four haploid cells (D) four diploid cells
Answer:",C
1727,"Context: During meiosis I, the pairs of homologous chromosomes are separated from each other. This requires that they line up in their homologous paris during metaphase I. The steps are outlined below: 1. Prophase I: The homologous chromosomes line up together. During this time, a process that only happens in meiosis can occur. This process is called crossing-over ( Figure 1.2), which is the exchange of DNA between homologous chromosomes. Crossing-over forms new combinations of alleles on the resulting chromosome. Without crossing-over, the offspring would always inherit all of the alleles on one of the homologous chromo- somes. Also during prophase I, the spindle forms, the chromosomes condense as they coil up tightly, and the nuclear envelope disappears. 2. Metaphase I: The homologous chromosomes line up in their pairs in the middle of the cell. Chromosomes from the mother or from the father can each attach to either side of the spindle. Their attachment is random, so all of the chromosomes from the mother or father do not end up in the same gamete. The gamete will contain some chromosomes from the mother and some chromosomes from the father. 3. Anaphase I: The homologous chromosomes are separated as the spindle shortens, and begin to move to opposite sides (opposite poles) of the cell. 4. Telophase I: The spindle fibers dissolves, but a new nuclear envelope does not need to form. This is because, after cytokinesis, the nucleus will immediately begin to divide again. No DNA replication occurs between meiosis I and meiosis II because the chromosomes are already duplicated. After cytokinesis, two haploid cells result, each with chromosomes made of sister chromatids. Since the separation of chromosomes into gametes is random during meiosis I, this process results in different combinations of chromosomes (and alleles) in each gamete. With 23 pairs of chromosomes, there is a possibility of over 8 million different combinations of chromosomes (223 ) in a human gamete. During crossing-over, segments of DNA are exchanged between non-sister chro- matids of homologous chromosomes. Notice how this can result in an allele (A) on one chromatid being moved onto the other non-sister chromatid.

1732,"Context: To begin mitosis, the DNA in the nucleus wraps around proteins to form chromosomes. Each organism has a unique number of chromosomes. In human cells, our DNA is divided up into 23 pairs of chromosomes. Replicated DNA forms a chromosome made from two identical sister chromatids, forming an ""X"" shaped molecule ( Figure 1.1). The two chromatids are held together on the chromosome by the centromere. The centromere is also where spindle fiber microtubules attach during mitosis. The spindles separate sister chromatids from each other. 
Question: sister chromatids have an identical dna sequence.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
1733,"Context: During mitosis, the two sister chromatids must be divided. This is a precise process that has four individual phases to it. After the sister chromatids separate, each separate chromatid is now known as a chromosome. Each resulting chromosome is made of DNA from just one chromatid. So, each chromosome after this separation is made of ""1/2 of the X."" Through this process, each daughter cell receives one copy of each chromosome. The four phases of mitosis are prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase ( Figure 1.2). 1. Prophase: The chromatin, which is unwound DNA, condenses forming chromosomes. The DNA becomes so tightly wound that you can see them under a microscope. The membrane around the nucleus, called the nuclear envelope, disappears. Spindles also form and attach to chromosomes to help them move. 2. Metaphase: The chromosomes line up in the center, or the equator, of the cell. The chromosomes line up in a row, one on top of the next. 3. Anaphase: The two sister chromatids of each chromosome separate as the spindles pull the chromatids apart, resulting in two sets of identical chromosomes. 4. Telophase: The spindle dissolves and nuclear envelopes form around the chromosomes in both cells. An overview of the cell cycle and mito- sis: during prophase the chromosomes condense, during metaphase the chromo- somes line up, during anaphase the sister chromatids are pulled to opposite sides of the cell, and during telophase the nuclear envelope forms. This is a representation of dividing plant cells. Cell division in plant cells differs slightly from animal cells as a cell wall must form. Note that most of the cells are in interphase. Can you find examples of the different stages of mitosis?

1734,"Context: To begin mitosis, the DNA in the nucleus wraps around proteins to form chromosomes. Each organism has a unique number of chromosomes. In human cells, our DNA is divided up into 23 pairs of chromosomes. Replicated DNA forms a chromosome made from two identical sister chromatids, forming an ""X"" shaped molecule ( Figure 1.1). The two chromatids are held together on the chromosome by the centromere. The centromere is also where spindle fiber microtubules attach during mitosis. The spindles separate sister chromatids from each other.

Options:(A) anaphase (B) metaphase (C) telophase (D) prophase
Answer:",B
1735,"Context: During mitosis, the two sister chromatids must be divided. This is a precise process that has four individual phases to it. After the sister chromatids separate, each separate chromatid is now known as a chromosome. Each resulting chromosome is made of DNA from just one chromatid. So, each chromosome after this separation is made of ""1/2 of the X."" Through this process, each daughter cell receives one copy of each chromosome. The four phases of mitosis are prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase ( Figure 1.2). 1. Prophase: The chromatin, which is unwound DNA, condenses forming chromosomes.

1738,"Context: The structure of a neuron suits it for its function of transmitting nerve impulses. You can see what a neuron looks like in Figure 20.2. It has a special shape that lets it pass electrical signals to and from other cells. A neuron has three main parts: cell body, dendrites, and axon. 1. The cell body contains the nucleus and other organelles. 2. Dendrites receive nerve impulses from other cells. A single neuron may have thousands of dendrites. 3. The axon passes on the nerve impulses to other cells. It branches at the end into multiple nerve endings so it can transmit impulses to many other cells. 
Question: a dendrite is the long, threadlike part of a neuron that transmits nerve impulses to other cells.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
1739,"Context: The nerve endings of an axon dont actually touch the dendrites of other neurons. The messages must cross a tiny gap between the two neurons, called the synapse. Chemicals called neurotransmitters carry the message across this gap. When a nerve impulse arrives at the end of an axon, neurotransmitters are released. They travel across the synaptic gap to a dendrite of another neuron. The neurotransmitters bind to the membrane of the dendrite, triggering a nerve impulse in the next neuron. You can see how this works in Figure 20.3 and in this animation:  The transmission of nerve impulses between neurons is like the passing of a baton between runners in a relay race. After the first runner races, she passes the baton to the second runner. Then the second runner takes over. Instead of a baton, a neuron passes neurotransmitters to the next neuron. 
Question: neurotransmitters are the electrical signals carried by nerve cells.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
1740,"Context: A neuron has a special shape that lets it pass signals from one cell to another. A neuron has three main parts ( Figure 1. The cell body. 2. Many dendrites. 3. One axon. The cell body contains the nucleus and other organelles. Dendrites and axons connect to the cell body, similar to rays coming off of the sun. Dendrites receive nerve impulses from other cells. Axons pass the nerve impulses on to other cells. A single neuron may have thousands of dendrites, so it can communicate with thousands of other cells but only one axon. The axon is covered with a myelin sheath, a fatty layer that insulates the axon and allows the electrical signal to travel much more quickly. The node of Ranvier is any gap within the myelin sheath exposing the axon, and it allows even faster transmission of a signal. 
Question: which part of the nerve cell passes the signal onto other cells?
Options:(A) the cell body (B) the dendrite (C) the axon (D) the node of Ranvier
Answer:",C
1741,"Context: Neurons are usually classified based on the role they play in the body. Two main types of neurons are sensory neurons and motor neurons. Sensory neurons carry nerve impulses from sense organs and internal organs to the central nervous system. Motor neurons carry nerve impulses from the central nervous system to organs, glands, and musclesthe opposite direction. Both types of neurons work together. Sensory neurons carry information about the environment found inside or outside of the body to the central nervous system. The central nervous system uses the information to send messages through motor neurons to tell the body how to respond to the information. 
Question: which neurons carry nerve impulses from the central nervous system to organs, glands, and muscles?
Options:(A) sensory neurons (B) muscle neurons (C) action neurons (D) motor neurons
Answer:",D
1742,"Context: The nervous system is made up of nerves. A nerve is a bundle of nerve cells. A nerve cell that carries messages is called a neuron. The messages carried by neurons are called nerve impulses. A nerve impulse can travel very quickly because it is an electrical signal. Think about flipping on a light switch when you enter a room. When you flip the switch, electricity flows to the light through wires inside the walls. The electricity may have to travel many meters to reach the light. Nonetheless, the light still comes on as soon as you flip the switch. Nerve impulses travel just as quickly through the network of nerves inside the body. 
Question: which best describes a neuron?
Options:(A) one dendrite and many axons covered with a myelin sheath interrupted by nodes of Ranvier (B) many dendrites and one axon covered with a myelin sheath interrupted by (C) many dendrites and one axon covered with a myelin sheath interrupted by the synapse (D) one dendrite and many axons covered with a myelin sheath interrupted by the synapse
Answer:",B
1743,"Context: The place where the axon of one neuron meets the dendrite of another is called a synapse. Synapses are also found between neurons and other types of cells, such as muscle cells. The axon of the sending neuron does not actually touch the dendrite of the receiving neuron. There is a tiny gap between them, the synaptic cleft ( Figure 1.2). The following steps describe what happens when a nerve impulse reaches the end of an axon. 1. 2. 3. 4. When a nerve impulse reaches the end of an axon, the axon releases chemicals called neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters travel across the synapse between the axon and the dendrite of the next neuron. Neurotransmitters bind to the membrane of the dendrite. The binding allows the nerve impulse to travel through the receiving neuron. Did you ever watch a relay race? After the first runner races, he or she passes the baton to the next runner, who takes over. Neurons are a little like relay runners. Instead of a baton, they pass neurotransmitters to the next neuron. Examples of neurotransmitters are chemicals such as serotonin, dopamine, and adrenaline. You can watch an animation of nerve impulses and neurotransmitters at  Some people have low levels of the neurotransmitter called serotonin in their brain. Scientists think that this is one cause of depression. Medications called antidepressants help bring serotonin levels back to normal. For many people with depression, antidepressants control the symptoms of their depression and help them lead happy, productive lives.

1744,"Context: Anemia is a disease that occurs when there is not enough hemoglobin (or iron) in the blood so it cant carry adequate oxygen to the cells. There are many possible causes of anemia. One possible cause is excessive blood loss due to an injury or surgery. Not getting enough iron in the diet is another possible cause.

Answer:",C
1745,"Context: Each trait Mendel studied was controlled by one gene with two alleles. In each case, one of the alleles was dominant to the other. This resulted in just two possible phenotypes for each trait. Each trait Mendel studied was also controlled by a gene on a different chromosome. As a result, each trait was inherited independently of the others. With traits like these, its easy to predict which forms of a trait will show up in the offspring of a given set of parents. 
Question: every human trait has one dominant allele and one recessive allele.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
1746,"Context: Flowering plants can reproduce two different ways: 1. Self-pollination: Pollen falls on the stigma of the same flower. This way, a seed will be produced that can turn into a genetically identical plant. 2. Cross-fertilization: Pollen from one flower travels to a stigma of a flower on another plant. Pollen travels from flower to flower by wind or by animals. Flowers that are pollinated by animals such as birds, butterflies, or bees are often colorful and provide nectar, a sugary reward, for their animal pollinators. 
Question: white flowers crossed with red flowers can sometimes make pink flowers.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
1747,"Context: You know that the B allele is dominant to the b allele. Therefore, you can also use the Punnett square in Figure 6.8 to predict the most likely offspring phonotypes. If the parents had four offspring, their most likely phenotypes would be three with purple flowers (1 BB + 2 Bb) and one with white flowers (1 bb). 
Question: what will be the phenotype of an iai individual?
Options:(A) type A blood (B) type B blood (C) type O blood (D) type I blood
Answer:",A
1748,"Context: Another exception to Mendels laws is a phenomenon called codominance. For example, our blood type shows codominance. Do you know what your blood type is? Are you A? O? AB? Those letters actually represent alleles. Unlike other traits, your blood type has three alleles, instead of two! The ABO blood types ( Figure 1.3) are named for the protein attached to the outside of the blood cell. In this case, two alleles are dominant and completely expressed (IA and IB ), while one allele is recessive (i). The IA allele encodes for red blood cells with the A antigen, while the IB allele encodes for red blood cells with the B antigen. The recessive allele (i) does not encode for any proteins. Therefore a person with two recessive alleles (ii) has type O blood. As no dominant (IA and IB ) allele is present, the person cannot have type A or type B blood. What are the genotypes of a person with type A or type B blood? An example of codominant inheritance is ABO blood types. There are two possible genotypes for type A blood, homozygous (IA IA ) and heterozygous (IA i), and two possible genotypes for type B blood, (IB IB and IB i). If a person is heterozygous for both the IA and IB alleles, they will express both and have type AB blood with both proteins on each red blood cell. This pattern of inheritance is significantly different than Mendels rules for inheritance, because both alleles are expressed completely, and one does not mask the other. 
Question: what is the genotype of an individual with type o blood?
Options:(A) IOIO (B) IIII (C) IOi (D) ii
Answer:",D
1749,"Context: One allele is NOT always completely dominant over another allele. Sometimes an individual has a phenotype between the two parents because one allele is not dominant over another. This pattern of inheritance is called incomplete dominance. For example, snapdragon flowers show incomplete dominance. One of the genes for flower color in snapdragons has two alleles, one for red flowers and one for white flowers. A plant that is homozygous for the red allele (RR) will have red flowers, while a plant that is homozygous for the white allele will have white flowers (WW). But the heterozygote will have pink flowers (RW) ( Figure 1.1) as both alleles are expressed. Neither the red nor the white allele is dominant, so the phenotype of the offspring is a blend of the two parents. Pink snapdragons are an example of in- complete dominance. Another example of incomplete dominance is with sickle cell anemia, a disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly. This causes the red blood cells to have a sickle shape, making it difficult for these misshapen cells to pass through the smallest blood vessels. A person that is homozygous recessive (ss) for the sickle cell trait will have red blood cells that all have the incorrect hemoglobin. A person who is homozygous dominant (SS) will have normal red blood cells. What type of blood cells do you think a person who is heterozygous (Ss) for the trait will have? They will have some misshapen cells and some normal cells ( Figure 1.2). Both the dominant and recessive alleles are expressed, so the result is a phenotype that is a combination of the recessive and dominant traits. Sickle cell anemia causes red blood cells to become misshapen and curved unlike normal, rounded red blood cells. 
Question: snapdragons have a dominant red allele and a dominant white allele for flower color. what is the genotype for flower color of a heterozygous flower?
Options:(A) Rr (B) Ww (C) RW (D) rw

1751,"Context: Recall that people with type O blood do not have any antigens on their RBCs. As a result, type O blood can be given to people with blood types A, B, or AB. If there are no antigens on the RBCs, there cannot be an antibody reaction in the blood. People with type O blood are often called universal donors. The blood plasma of AB blood does not contain any anti-A or anti-B antibodies. People with type AB blood can receive any ABO blood type. People with type AB blood are called universal recipients because they can receive any blood type. The antigens and antibodies that define blood type are listed as follows ( Table 1.1). Blood Type Antigen Type Plasma Antibodies A B AB O A B A and B none anti-B anti-A none anti-A, anti-B Can Receive Blood from Types A,O B,O AB, A, B, O O Can Donate Blood to Types A, AB B, AB AB AB, A, B, O

1753,"Context: The mitochondrion (mitochondria, plural) is an organelle that makes energy available to the cell. Its like the power plant of a cell. It uses energy in glucose to make smaller molecules called ATP (adenosine triphosphate). ATP packages energy in smaller amounts that cells can use. Think about buying a bottle of water from a vending machine. The machine takes only quarters, and you have only dollar bills. The dollar bills wont work in the vending machine. Glucose is like a dollar bill. It contains too much energy for cells to use. ATP is like a quarter. It contains just the right amount of energy for use by cells.

Options:(A) a vesicle (B) a lysosome (C) a vacuole (D) a ribosome
Answer:",B
1756,"Context: A ribosome is a small organelle where proteins are made. Its like a factory in the cell. It gathers amino acids and joins them together into proteins. Unlike other organelles, the ribosome is not surrounded by a membrane. As a result, some scientists do not classify it as an organelle. Ribosomes may be found floating in the cytoplasm. Some ribosomes are located on the surface of another organelle, the endoplasmic reticulum.

This code tells the cell which proteins to make and when to make them. You can see a diagram of a cell nucleus in Figure 3.10. Besides DNA, the nucleus contains a structure called a nucleolus. Its function is to form ribosomes. The membrane enclosing the nucleus is called the nuclear envelope. The envelope has tiny holes, or pores, in it. The pores allow substances to move into and out of the nucleus.

Answer:",D
1759,"Context: Recall that the cell membrane is semipermeable. It does not allow everything to pass through. Some molecules can pass easily through your cell membranes, while others have more difficulty. Sometimes molecules need the help of special transport proteins to move across the cell membrane. Some molecules even need an input of energy to help get them across the cell membrane. The movement of molecules across a membrane without the input of energy is known as passive transport. When energy (ATP) is needed, the movement is known as active transport. Active transport moves molecules against their concentration gradient, from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration. 
Question: passive transport requires energy.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
1760,"Context: One example of passive transport is diffusion, when molecules move from an area of high concentration (large amount) to an area of low concentration (low amount). Molecules are said to naturally flow down their concentration gradient. This type of diffusion proceeds without an input of energy. In simple diffusion, molecules that are small and uncharged can freely diffuse across a cell membrane. They simply flow through the cell membrane. Simple diffusion does not require energy or need the assistance of a transport protein. Other larger or charged molecules that diffuse across a membrane may need assistance from a protein. Oxygen is a molecule that can freely diffuse across a cell membrane. For example, oxygen diffuses out of the air sacs in your lungs into your bloodstream because oxygen is more concentrated in your lungs than in your blood. Oxygen moves from the high concentration of oxygen in your lungs to the low concentration of oxygen in your bloodstream. Carbon dioxide, which is exhaled, moves in the opposite direction - from a high concentration in your bloodstream to a low concentration in your lungs. 
Question: diffusion is a type of passive transport.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
1761,"Context: Sodium and potassium are two of the most important elements in living things. They are present mainly as positively charged ions dissolved in water. The sodium-potassium pump moves sodium ions (Na+ ) out of the cell and potassium ions (K+ ) into the cell. In both cases, the ions are moving from an area of lower to higher concentration. Energy in ATP is needed for this ""uphill"" process. Figure 4.4 shows how this pump works. Trace these steps from left to right in the figure: 1. Three sodium ions inside the cell bind with a carrier protein in the cell membrane. 2. The carrier protein receives a phosphate from ATP. This forms ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and releases energy. 3. The energy causes the carrier protein to change shape. As it does, it pumps the three sodium ions out of the cell. 4. Two potassium ions outside the cell next bind with the carrier protein. Then the process reverses, and the two potassium ions are pumped into the cell. 
Question: how would a sodium ion cross the cell membrane?
Options:(A) by simple diffusion (B) by facilitative diffusion (C) by facilitative transport (D) by active transport
Answer:",B
1762,"Context: Simple diffusion occurs when a substance diffuses through a cell membrane without any help from other molecules. The substance simply passes through tiny spaces in the membrane. It moves from the side of the membrane where it is more concentrated to the side where it is less concentrated. You can see how this happens in Figure 4.2. Substances that cross cell membranes by simple diffusion must squeeze between the lipid molecules in the mem- brane. As a result, the diffusing molecules must be very small. Oxygen (O2 ) and carbon dioxide (CO2 ) are examples of molecules that can cross cell membranes this way. When you breathe in, oxygen is more concentrated in the air in your lungs than it is in your blood. So oxygen diffuses from your lungs to your blood. The reverse happens with carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is more concentrated in your blood than it is in the air in your lungs. So carbon dioxide diffuses out of your blood to your lungs. 
Question: what type of molecule would pass through the membrane by simple diffusion?
Options:(A) an oxygen molecule (B) starch (C) a protein (D) a sodium ion
Answer:",A
1763,"Context: Cellular respiration is the process in which cells break down glucose, release the stored energy, and use the energy to make ATP. For each glucose molecule that undergoes this process, up to 38 molecules of ATP are produced. Each ATP molecules forms when a phosphate is added to ADP, or adenosine diphosphate. This requires energy, which is stored in the ATP molecule. When cells need energy, a phosphate can be removed from ATP. This releases the energy and forms ADP again. 
Question: atp is used as energy by the cell. which process requires atp?
Options:(A) a carrier protein in passive transport (B) a channel protein (C) active transport (D) All of the above require ATP
Answer:",C
1764,"Context: The cells of the body have a lower concentration of oxygen that does blood in the capillaries that supply body cells. Therefore, oxygen diffuses from the blood into the cells. Carbon dioxide, which cells produce in cellular respiration, is more concentrated in the cells. Therefore, carbon dioxide diffuses out of the cells and into the blood. The carbon dioxide travels in capillaries to veins and then to the heart. The heart pumps the blood to the lungs, where the carbon dioxide diffuses into the alveoli. It passes out of the body during exhalation. This brings the process of respiration full circle. 
Question: carbon dioxide is a waste product of your cells metabolism. you exhale carbon dioxide from your lungs. carbon dioxide travels from your cells to your lungs through your blood. which statement best describes how carbon dioxide enters your blood?
Options:(A) Carbon dioxide moves from a low concentration in your cells to the high concentration in your bloodstream (B) Carbon dioxide moves from a high concentration in your cells to the low (C) Carbon dioxide moves from a high concentration in your lungs to the low concentration in your bloodstream (D) Carbon dioxide moves from a low concentration in your lungs to the high concentration in your bloodstream

The second is a fact drawn from the prior observations. The third is an opinion, since she might actually have allergies or the flu. Tests could be done to see what is causing her illness. 3. This is a fact. Many, many scientific experiments have shown that colds are caused by viruses. 4. While that sounds like a fact, the scientific evidence is mixed. One reputable study published in 2007 showed a decrease of 58%, but several other studies have shown no beneficial effect. 5. Bill Gates is the wealthiest man in the United States; thats a fact. But theres no evidence that hes also the smartest man, and chances are hes not. This is an opinion. 6. This sounds like a fact, but it is not. It is easy to test. Gather together a large number of subjects, each with a friend. Have the friends fill out a questionnaire describing the subject.

Its also the site of many metabolic reactions. For example, cellular respiration takes place in the cell membrane. Most prokaryotes also have a cell wall. It lies just outside the cell membrane. It makes the cell stronger and more rigid. Many prokaryotes have another layer, called a capsule, outside the cell wall. The capsule protects the cell from chemicals and drying out. It also allows the cell to stick to surfaces and to other cells. You can see a model of a prokaryotic cell in Figure 8.5. Find the cell membrane, cell wall, and capsule in the figure. 
Question: which organelle is outside the cell membrane?
Options:(A) the plasma membrane (B) the plasma wall (C) the cell wall (D) the outer membrane
Answer:",C
1771,"Context: Most plant cells have a large central vacuole. It can make up as much as 90 percent of a plant cells total volume. The central vacuole is like a large storage container. It may store substances such as water, enzymes, and salts. It may have other roles as well. For example, the central vacuole helps stems and leaves hold their shape. It may also contain pigments that give flowers their colors. 
Question: which organelle stores water for the plant cell?
Options:(A) the vacuole (B) the chloroplast (C) the large central vacuole (D) the vesicle
Answer:",C
1772,"Context: Even though plants and animals are both eukaryotes, plant cells differ in some ways from animal cells ( Figure organelles of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis converts the suns solar energy into chemical energy. This chemical energy, which is the carbohydrate glucose, serves as ""food"" for the plant. 
Question: which organelle turns solar energy into chemical energy?
Options:(A) the chloroplast (B) the mitochondria (C) the Golgi apparatus (D) the endoplasmic reticulum
Answer:",A
1773,"Context: Seed plants are vascular plants that reproduce with seeds. Modern seed plants are called spermatophytes. Seeds allow the plants to reproduce without water. Most vascular plants today are seed plants. Modern seed plants include gymnosperms and angiosperms. Gymnosperms are seed plants that produce naked seeds in cones. There are about 1000 species of gym- nosperms. Conifers are the most common group of gymnosperms. The spruce tree in Figure 10.21 is an example of a conifer. Angiosperms are seed plants that produce seeds in the ovaries of flowers. Today, they are by far the most diverse type of seed plants. In fact, the vast majority of all modern plants are angiosperms. There are hundreds of thousands of species of them. The apple tree in Figure 10.21 is an example of a common angiosperm. 
Question: all plants produce seeds.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
1774,"Context: Plants are multicellular eukaryotes that are placed in the Plant Kingdom. Plant cells have cell walls that are made of cellulose. Plant cells also have chloroplasts. They allow plants to make food by photosynthesis. In addition, plants have specialized reproductive organs that produce gametes. Male reproductive organs produce sperm. Female reproductive organs produce eggs. Male and female reproductive organs may be on the same plant or on different plants. 
Question: like humans, eukaryotic multicellular plants are made entirely of diploid cells.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
1775,"Context: Seed plants also evolved other reproductive structures. These included ovules, pollen, and pollen tubes. An ovule is a female reproductive structure in seed plants. It contains a tiny female gametophyte. The gametophyte produces an egg cell. After the egg is fertilized by sperm, the ovule develops into a seed. Pollen is a tiny male gametophyte enclosed in a tough capsule. Pollen carries sperm to an ovule while preventing the sperm from drying out. Pollen grains cant swim, but they are very light, so the wind can carry them. Therefore, they can travel through air instead of water. Pollen also evolved the ability to grow a tube, called a pollen tube. Sperm could be transferred through the tube directly from the pollen grain to the egg. This allowed sperm to reach an egg without swimming through a film of water. It finally freed plants from depending on moisture to reproduce. 
Question: in plants, what structure produces gametes? what process produces gametes?
Options:(A) The sporophyte produces gametes by mitosis (B) The sporophyte produces gametes by meiosis (C) The gametophyte produces the gametes by mitosis (D) The gametophyte produces gametes by meiosis
Answer:",C
1776,"Context: One of the two generations of a plants life cycle is usually dominant. Individuals in the dominant generation generally live longer and grow larger. They are the organisms that you would recognize as a fern, tree, or other plant. Individuals in the nondominant generation tend to be smaller and shorter-lived. They often live in or on the dominant plant. They may go unnoticed. Early plants spent most of their life cycle as gametophytes. Some modern plants such as mosses still have this type of life cycle. However, almost all modern plants spend most of their life cycle as sporophytes. 
Question: in an alternation of generations life cycle, the gametophyte is part of which generation?
Options:(A) the diploid generation (B) the haploid generation (C) both generations (D) the gamete generation
Answer:",B
1777,"Context: Plants alternate between haploid and diploid generations. Haploid cells have one of each pair of chromosomes. Diploid cells have two of each pair. Plants in the haploid generation are called gametophytes. They form from haploid spores. They have male and/or female reproductive organs and reproduce sexually. They produce haploid gametes by mitosis. Fertilization of gametes produces diploid zygotes. Zygotes develop into the diploid generation. Plants in the diploid generation are called sporophytes. They form from the fertilization of gametes. They reproduce asexually. They have a structure called a sporangium that produces haploid spores by meiosis. Spores develop into the haploid generation. Then the cycle repeats. 
Question: in an alternation of generations life cycle, a diploid zygote develops into
Options:(A) the sporophyte (B) the gametophyte (C) mature spores (D) none of the above
Answer:",A
1778,"Context: The life cycle of a plant is very different from the life cycle of an animal. Humans are made entirely of diploid cells (cells with two sets of chromosomes, referred to as 2n). Our only cells that are haploid cells (cells with one set of chromosomes, n) are sperm and egg cells. Plants, however, can live when they are are at the stage of having haploid cells or diploid cells. If a plant has a haploid chromosome number of 20, what is the diploid chromosome number? If the diploid chromosome number is 20, what is the haploid number? Plants alternate between diploid-cell plants and haploid-cell plants. This is called alternation of generations, because the plant type alternates from generation to generation. In alternation of generations, the plant alternates between a sporophyte that has diploid cells and a gametophyte that has haploid cells. Alternation of generations can be summarized in the following four steps: follow along in the Figure 1.1 as you read through the steps. 1. The haploid gametophyte produces the gametes, or sperm and egg, by mitosis. Remember, gametes are haploid, having one set of chromosomes. 2. Then, the sperm fertilizes the egg, producing a diploid zygote that develops into the sporophyte, which of course, is diploid. 3. The diploid sporophyte produces haploid spores by meiosis. 4. The haploid spores go through mitosis, developing into the haploid gametophyte. As we will see in additional Plants concepts, the generation in which the plant spends most of its life cycle is different between various plants. In the plants that first evolved, the gametophyte takes up the majority of the life cycle of the plant. During the course of evolution, the sporophyte became the major stage of the life cycle of the plant. In ferns, the sporophyte is dominant and produces spores that germinate into a heart-shaped gametophyte. 
Question: in a plant, if an egg cell has 20 chromosomes, how many chromosomes will be in the sporophyte?
Options:(A) 10 (B) 20 (C) 30 (D) 40

1780,"Context: Prokaryotic cells are cells that lack a nucleus. The DNA in prokaryotic cells is in the cytoplasm, rather than enclosed within a nuclear membrane. All the organisms in the Bacteria and Archaea Domains have prokaryotic cells. No other organisms have this type of cell. Organisms with prokaryotic cells are called prokaryotes. They are all single-celled organisms. They were the first type of organisms to evolve. They are still the most numerous organisms today. You can see a model of a prokaryotic cell in Figure 3.3. The cell in the figure is a bacterium. Notice how it contains a cell membrane, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and several other structures. However, the cell lacks a nucleus. The cells DNA is circular. It coils up in a mass called a nucleoid that floats in the cytoplasm.

1781,"Context: All of the cells in the domain Eukarya keep their genetic material, or DNA, inside the nucleus. The domain Eukarya is made up of four kingdoms: 1. Plantae: Plants, such as trees and grasses, survive by capturing energy from the sun, a process called photo- synthesis. 2. Fungi: Fungi, such as mushrooms and molds, survive by ""eating"" other organisms or the remains of other organisms. These organisms absorb their nutrients from other organisms. 3. Animalia: Animals also survive by eating other organisms or the remains of other organisms. Animals range from tiny ants to the largest whales, and include arthropods, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals ( Figure 4.

1782,"Context: If you zoom in very close on a leaf of a plant, or on the skin on your hand, or a drop of blood, you will find cells, you will find cells ( Figure 1.2). Cells are the smallest structural and functional unit of all living organisms. Most cells are so small that they are usually visible only through a microscope. Some organisms, like bacteria, plankton that live in the ocean, or the Paramecium, shown in Figure 1.3, are unicellular, made of just one cell. Other organisms have millions, billions, or trillions of cells. All cells have at least some structures in common, such as ribosomes, which are the sites where proteins are made. All cells also have DNA and proteins. The nucleus is clearly visible in the blood cells ( Figure 1.2). The nucleus can be described as the ""information center,"" containing the instructions (DNA) for making all the proteins in a cell, as well as how much of each protein to make. The nucleus is also the main distinguishing feature between the two general categories of cell, with cells known as prokaryotic lacking a nucleus. Although the cells of different organisms are built differently, they all have certain general functions. Every cell must get energy from food, be able to grow and divide, and respond to its environment. More about cell structure and function will be discussed in additional concepts.

1784,"Context: The mitochondrion (mitochondria, plural) is an organelle that makes energy available to the cell. Its like the power plant of a cell. It uses energy in glucose to make smaller molecules called ATP (adenosine triphosphate). ATP packages energy in smaller amounts that cells can use. Think about buying a bottle of water from a vending machine. The machine takes only quarters, and you have only dollar bills. The dollar bills wont work in the vending machine. Glucose is like a dollar bill. It contains too much energy for cells to use. ATP is like a quarter. It contains just the right amount of energy for use by cells.

Options:(A) ribosome (B) mitochondria (C) endoplasmic reticulum (D) Golgi apparatus
Answer:",B
1785,"Context: A ribosome is a small organelle where proteins are made. Its like a factory in the cell. It gathers amino acids and joins them together into proteins. Unlike other organelles, the ribosome is not surrounded by a membrane. As a result, some scientists do not classify it as an organelle. Ribosomes may be found floating in the cytoplasm. Some ribosomes are located on the surface of another organelle, the endoplasmic reticulum.

1786,"Context: Inside of the nucleus, you will find the chromosomes. Chromosomes are strands of DNA wrapped around proteins. They contain genes, or small units of genetic material (DNA) that contains the code for the creation of a protein. Human cells have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs). There are hundreds to thousands of genes on each chromosome. 
Question: chromosomes are protected by the __________.

1787,"Context: A monomer is a molecule that can bind to other monomers to form a polymer. Amino acids are the monomers of a protein. The DNA sequence contains the instructions to place amino acids into a specific order. When the amino acid monomers are assembled in that specific order, proteins are made, a process called protein synthesis. In short, DNA contains the instructions to create proteins. But DNA does not directly make the proteins. Proteins are made on the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, and DNA (in an eukaryotic cell) is in the nucleus. So the cell uses an RNA intermediate to produce proteins. Each strand of DNA has many separate sequences that code for a specific protein. Insulin is an example of a protein made by your cells ( Figure 1.1). Units of DNA that contain code for the creation of a protein are called genes.

1789,"Context: There are about 22,000 genes in every human cell. Does every human cell have the same genes? Yes. Does every human cell make the same proteins? No. In a multicellular organism, such as us, cells have specific functions because they have different proteins. They have different proteins because different genes are expressed in different cell types (which is known as gene expression). Imagine that all of your genes are ""turned off."" Each cell type only ""turns on"" (or expresses) the genes that have the code for the proteins it needs to use. So different cell types ""turn on"" different genes, allowing different proteins to be made. This gives different cell types different functions. Once a gene is expressed, the protein product of that gene is usually made. For this reason, gene expression and protein synthesis are often considered the same process. 
Question: about how many genes are in every human cell?

1790,"Context: Today we know that the traits of organisms are controlled by genes on chromosomes. A gene can be defined as a section of a chromosome that contains the genetic code for a particular protein. The position of a gene on a chromosome is called its locus. Each gene may have different versions. The different versions are called alleles. Figure 6.6 shows an example in pea plants. It shows the gene for flower color. The gene has two alleles. There is a purple-flower allele and a white-flower allele. Different alleles account for most of the variation in the traits of organisms within a species. In sexually reproducing species, chromosomes are present in cells in pairs. Chromosomes in the same pair are called homologous chromosomes. They have the same genes at the same loci. These may be the same or different alleles. During meiosis, when gametes are produced, homologous chromosomes separate. They go to different gametes. Thus, the alleles for each gene also go to different gametes.

1791,"Context: Although cells share many of the same features and structures, they also can be very different ( Figure 1.3). Each cell in your body is designed for a specific task. In other words, the cells function is partly based on the cells structure. For example: Red blood cells are shaped with a pocket that traps oxygen and brings it to other body cells. Nerve cells are long and stringy in order to form a line of communication with other nerve cells, like a wire. Because of this shape, they can quickly send signals, such as the feeling of touching a hot stove, to your brain. Skin cells are flat and fit tightly together to protect your body. As you can see, cells are shaped in ways that help them do their jobs. Multicellular (many-celled) organisms have many types of specialized cells in their bodies. Red blood cells (left) are specialized to carry oxygen in the blood. Neurons (cen- ter ) are shaped to conduct electrical im- pulses to many other nerve cells. These epidermal cells (right) make up the skin of plants. Note how the cells fit tightly together.

1795,"Context: The first animal trait to evolve was multicellularity. This is the presence of multiple cells in a single organism. Scientists think that the earliest animals with multiple cells evolved from animal-like protists that lived in colonies. Some of the cells in the colonies became specialized for different jobs. After a while, the specialized cells came to need each other for survival. Thus, the first multicellular animals evolved. Multicellularity was highly adaptive. Multiple cells could do different jobs. They could evolve special adaptations that allowed them to do a particular job really well. Modern animals that represent this stage of animal evolution are sponges. They are placed in Phylum Porifera (see Table 11.1). They have multiple specialized cells, but their cells are not organized into tissues.

Options:(A) they cannot eat (B) they cannot move (C) they do not have a brain (D) they are not photosynthetic
Answer:",B
1797,"Context: Sponges reproduce both asexually and sexually. Asexual reproduction occurs by budding. Sexual reproduction occurs by the production of eggs and sperm. Males release sperm into the water through the osculum. Sperm may enter a female sponge through a pore and fertilize her eggs. The resulting zygotes develop into larvae. Unlike sponge adults, sponge larvae can swim. They have cilia that propel them through the water. As larvae develop and grow, they become more similar to an adult sponge and lose their ability to swim. 
Question: which best describes the asexual reproduction of sponges?
Options:(A) Asexual reproduction in sponges occurs in the water when sperm are released and taken up by female sponges (B) Asexual reproduction in sponges is through budding (C) where a small bud forms from the parent organism (D) c Asexual reproduction in sponges is usually through internal buds known as (E) d All of the above describe asexual reproduction in sponges
Answer:",C
1798,"Context: Sponges ( Figure 1.1) are classified in the phylum Porifera, from the Latin words meaning ""having pores."" These pores allow the movement of water into the sponges sac-like bodies. Sponges must pump water through their bodies in order to eat. Because sponges are sessile, meaning they cannot move, they filter water to obtain their food. They are, therefore, known as filter feeders. Filter feeders must filter the water to separate out the organisms and nutrients they want to eat from those they do not. You might think that sponges dont look like animals at all. They dont have a head or legs. Internally, they do not have brains, stomachs, or other organs. This is because sponges evolved much earlier than other animals. In fact, sponges do not even have true tissues. Instead, their bodies are made up of specialized cells (cell-level organization) that do specific jobs. Other animals, including humans, have tissue-level organization because they have tissues with specific functions. Sponge cells perform a variety of bodily functions and appear to be more independent of each other than are the cells of other animals. For example, some cells control the flow of water, in and out of the sponge, by increasing or decreasing the size of the pores. The sponges often have tube-like bodies with many tiny pores. There are roughly 5,000 sponge species. Sponges are characterized by a feeding system unique among animals. As sponges dont have mouths, they must feed by some other method. Sponges have tiny pores in their outer walls through which water is drawn. Cells in the sponge walls filter food from the water as the water is pumped through the body and out other larger openings. The flow of water through the sponge is unidirectional, driven by the beating of flagella, which line the surface of chambers connected by a series of canals. Sponges reproduce by both asexual and sexual means. Sponges that reproduce asexually produce buds or, more often, structures called gemmules, which are packets of several cells of various types inside a protective covering. Freshwater sponges often produce gemmules prior to winter, which then develop into adult sponges beginning the following spring. Most sponges that reproduce sexually are hermaphroditic and produce eggs and sperm at different times. Sperm are frequently released into the water, where they are captured by sponges of the same species. The sperm are then transported to eggs, fertilization occurs and the zygotes develop into larvae. Some sponges release their larvae, where others retain them for some time. Once the larvae are in the water, they settle and develop into juvenile sponges. 
Question: complete this sentence. feeding in sponges

Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
1802,"Context: The answer is actually no. A virus is essentially DNA or RNA surrounded by a coat of protein ( Figure 1.1). It is not made of a cell, and cannot maintain a stable internal environment ( homeostasis). Recall that a cell is the basic unit of living organisms. So if a virus is not made of at least one cell, can it be living? Viruses also cannot reproduce on their ownthey need to infect a host cell to reproduce. So a virus is very different from any of the organisms that fall into the three domains of life. Though viruses are not considered living, they share two important traits with living organisms. They have genetic material like all cells do (though they are not made of cells), and they can evolve. The genetic material of a virus can change (mutate), altering the traits of the virus.

1808,"Context: The size of particles determines how they are carried by flowing water. This is illustrated in Figure 10.2. Minerals that dissolve in water form salts. The salts are carried in solution. They are mixed thoroughly with the water. Small particles, such as clay and silt, are carried in suspension. They are mixed throughout the water. These particles are not dissolved in the water. Somewhat bigger particles, such as sand, are moved by saltation. The particles move in little jumps near the stream bottom. They are nudged along by water and other particles. The biggest particles, including gravel and pebbles, are moved by traction. In this process, the particles roll or drag along the bottom of the water.

1811,"Context: When a solute dissolves, it separates into individual particles that spread evenly throughout the solvent. Exactly how this happens depends on the type of bonds the solute contains. Solutes with ionic bonds, such as table salt (NaCl), separate into individual ions (Na+ and Cl ). Solutes with covalent bonds, such as glucose (H6 C12 O6 ), separate into individual molecules. In either case, the individual ions or molecules spread apart and are surrounded by molecules of the solvent. This is illustrated in Figure 10.1 and in the videos at the URLs below.

1812,"Context: A solution forms when one substance dissolves in another. The substance that dissolves is called the solute. The substance it dissolves in is called the solvent. For example, ocean water is a solution in which the solute is salt and the solvent is water. In this example, a solid (salt) is dissolved in a liquid (water). However, matter in any state can be the solute or solvent in a solution. Solutions may be gases, liquids, or solids. In Table 10.1 and the video at the URL below, you can learn about solutions involving other states of matter. Solution Gas dissolved in gas Example: Earths atmosphere Gas dissolved in liquid Example: carbonated water Liquid dissolved in gas Example: moist air Solute oxygen (and other gases) Solvent nitrogen carbon dioxide water water air Solution Liquid dissolved in liquid Example: vinegar Solid dissolved in liquid Example: sweet tea Solid dissolved in solid Example: bronze Solute acetic acid Solvent water sugar tea copper tin When a solute dissolves in a solvent, it changes to the same state as the solvent. For example, when solid salt dissolves in liquid water, it becomes part of the liquid solution, salt water. If the solute and solvent are already in the same state, the substance present in greater quantity is considered to be the solvent. For example, nitrogen is the solvent in Earths atmosphere because it makes up 78 percent of air.

1814,"Context: Pure water freezes at 0  C, but the salt water in the ocean freezes at -2.2  C because of freezing point depression. We take advantage of the freezing point depression of salt in water by putting salt on ice to melt it. Thats why the truck in the Figure 1.1 is spreading salt on an icy road. Did you ever see anyone add a fluid to their car radiator? The fluid might be antifreeze, like in the Figure 1.2. Antifreeze lowers the temperature of the water in the car radiator so it wont freeze, even when the temperature falls far below 0  C. For example, a 50 percent antifreeze solution wont freeze unless the temperature goes below -37 C.

Options:(A) prevents snow from falling on the road (B) provides better traction than the ice (C) lowers the melting point of the ice (D) dissolves the ice
Answer:",C
1815,"Context: All solutes separate into individual particles when they dissolve, but the particles are different for ionic and covalent compounds. Ionic solutes separate into individual ions. Covalent solutes separate into individual molecules. Salt, or sodium chloride (NaCl), is an ionic compound. When it dissolves in water, it separates into positive sodium ions (Na+ ) and negative chloride ions (Cl ). You can see how this happens in the Figure 1.2. The negative oxygen ends of water molecules attract the positive sodium ions, and the positive hydrogen ends of water molecules attract the negative chloride ions. These forces of attraction pull the ions apart. The sugar glucose is a covalent compound. When sugar dissolves in water, it forms individual glucose molecules (C6 H12 O6 ). You can see how this happens in the Figure 1.3. Sugar is polar like water, so sugar molecules also have positive and negative ends. Forces of attraction between oppositely charged ends of water and sugar molecules pull individual sugar molecules away from the sugar crystal. Little by little, the sugar molecules are separated from the crystal and surrounded by water. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:

Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
1816,"Context: There is another factor that affects the rate of dissolving. The particle size of solute particles affects the rate. Smaller particles have greater surface area. Think of a large block of Legos. When all the blocks are stuck together you can measure their surface area. Now take all the blocks apart and measure their individual surface areas. Which has more? Greater surface area provides more contact between the particles and the solvent. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of iced tea, it will dissolve more quickly. If you put a sugar cube in a glass of iced tea, it will dissolve more slowly. Thats because all those tiny particles of granulated sugar have greater surface area than a single sugar cube. 
Question: Smaller particles of solute dissolve more quickly than larger particles.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
1817,"Context: All solutions have two parts: the solute and the solvent. The solute is the substance that dissolves, and the solvent is the substance that dissolves the solute. Particles of solvent pull apart particles of solute, and the solute particles spread throughout the solvent. Salt water, such as the ocean water in the Figure 1.1, is an example of a solution. In a saltwater solution, salt is the solute and water is the solvent. Q: A scientist obtained a sample of water from the Atlantic Ocean and determined that the sample was about 3.5 percent dissolved salt. Predict the percent of dissolved salt in a sample of water from the Pacific Ocean. A: As a solution, ocean water is a homogeneous mixture. Therefore, no matter where the water sample is obtained, its composition will be about 3.5 percent dissolved salt.

Answer:",B
1818,"Context: Water is a polar compound. This means it has positively and negatively charged ends. This is why it is so good at dissolving ionic compounds such as salt and polar covalent compounds such as sugar. Solutes that can dissolve in a given solvent, such as water, are said to be soluble in that solvent. So many solutes are soluble in water that water is called the universal solvent. However, there are substances that dont dissolve in water. Did you ever try to clean a paintbrush after painting with an oil-based paint? It doesnt work. Oil-based paint is nonpolar, so it doesnt dissolve in water. In other words, it is insoluble in water. Instead, a nonpolar solvent such as paint thinner must be used to dissolve nonpolar paint.

1820,"Context: If water gets hot enough, it starts to boil. Bubbles of water vapor form in boiling water. This happens as particles of liquid water gain enough energy to completely overcome the force of attraction between them and change to the gaseous state. The bubbles rise through the water and escape from the pot as steam. The process in which a liquid boils and changes to a gas is called vaporization. The temperature at which a liquid boils is its boiling point. The boiling point of water is 100C (212F). Other types of matter may have higher or lower boiling points. For example, the boiling point of table salt is 1413C. The boiling point of nitrogen is -196C.

1824,"Context: A solution forms when one substance is dissolved by another. The substance that dissolves is called the solute. The substance that dissolves it is called the solvent. The solute is present in a lesser amount that the solvent. When the solute dissolves, it separates into individual particles, which spread throughout the solvent. Q: In bronze, what are the solute and solvent? A: Because bronze consists mainly of copper, copper is the solvent and tin is the solute. The two metals are combined in a hot, molten state, but they form a solid solution at room temperature. 
Question: Bronze is a solution of copper dissolved in brass.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
1825,"Context: Certain factors can change the solubility of a solute. Temperature is one such factor. How temperature affects solubility depends on the state of the solute, as you can see in the Figure 1.1. If a solute is a solid or liquid, increasing the temperature increases its solubility. For example, more sugar can dissolve in hot water than in cold water. If a solute is a gas, increasing the temperature decreases its solubility. For example, less carbon dioxide can dissolve in warm water than in cold water. The solubility of gases is also affected by pressure. Pressure is the force pushing against a given area. Increasing the pressure on a gas increases its solubility. Did you ever open a can of soda and notice how it fizzes out of the can? Soda contains dissolved carbon dioxide. Opening the can reduces the pressure on the gas in solution, so it is less soluble. As a result, some of the carbon dioxide comes out of solution and rushes into the air. Q: Which do you think will fizz more when you open it, a can of warm soda or a can of cold soda? A: A can of warm soda will fizz more because increasing the temperature decreases the solubility of a gas. Therefore, less carbon dioxide can remain dissolved in warm soda than in cold soda. 
Question: The solute in carbonated water is a gas.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
1826,"Context: Stirring a solute into a solvent speeds up the rate of dissolving because it helps distribute the solute particles throughout the solvent. For example, when you add sugar to iced tea and then stir the tea, the sugar will dissolve faster. If you dont stir the iced tea, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. 
Question: Stirring a solution interferes with dissolving.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
1827,"Context: The temperature of the solvent is another factor that affects how fast a solute dissolves. Generally, a solute dissolves faster in a warmer solvent than it does in a cooler solvent because particles have more energy of movement. For example, if you add the same amount of sugar to a cup of hot tea and a cup of iced tea, the sugar will dissolve faster in the hot tea. 
Question: All solutes dissolve more quickly in warmer solvents.

Answer:",C
1829,"Context: Some lipids contain the element phosphorus as well as carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. These lipids are called phospholipids. Two layers of phospholipid molecules make up the cell membranes of living things. In the Figure One end of each phospholipid molecule is polar, so it has a partial electric charge. Water is also polar and has electrically charged ends, so it is attracted to the oppositely charged end of a phospholipid molecule. This end of the phospholipid molecule is described as hydrophilic, which means water loving. The other end of each phospholipid molecule is nonpolar and has no electric charge. This end of the phospho- lipid molecule repels polar water and is described as hydrophobic, or water hating. In the Figure 1.3, the hydrophilic ends of the phospholipid molecules are on the outsides of the cell membrane, and the hydrophobic ends are on the inside of the cell membrane. This arrangement of phospholipids allows some substances to pass through the cell membrane while keeping other substances out. 
Question: having oppositely charged ends

Answer:",G
1830,"Context: Salt isnt the only solute that dissolves in water. In fact, so many things dissolve in water that water is sometimes called the universal solvent. Water is such a good solvent because it is a very polar compound. A polar compound has positively and negatively charged ends. Solutes that are also charged are attracted to the oppositely charged ends of water molecules. This allows the water molecules to pull the solute particles apart. On the other hand, there are some substances that dont dissolve in water. Did you ever try to clean a paintbrush with water after painting with an oil-based paint? It doesnt work. Oil-based paint is nonpolar, so its particles arent charged. As a result, oil-based paint doesnt dissolve in water. (You can see how to dissolve oil-based paint in the Figure 1.1.)

1831,"Context: Not only salt, but many other solutes can dissolve in water. In fact, so many solutes can dissolve in water that water has been called the universal solvent. Even rocks can dissolve in water, which explains the cave that opened this article. A solute that can dissolve in a given solvent, such as water, is said to be soluble in that solvent. Conversely, a solute that cannot dissolve in a given solvent is said to be insoluble in that solvent. Although most solutes can dissolve in water, some solutes are insoluble in water. Oil is an example. Did you ever try to mix oil with water? No matter how well you mix the oil into the water, after the mixture stands for a while, the oil separates from the water and rises to the top. You can see how oil floats on ocean water in the Figure 1.2.

1839,"Context: Not only salt, but many other solutes can dissolve in water. In fact, so many solutes can dissolve in water that water has been called the universal solvent. Even rocks can dissolve in water, which explains the cave that opened this article. A solute that can dissolve in a given solvent, such as water, is said to be soluble in that solvent. Conversely, a solute that cannot dissolve in a given solvent is said to be insoluble in that solvent. Although most solutes can dissolve in water, some solutes are insoluble in water. Oil is an example. Did you ever try to mix oil with water? No matter how well you mix the oil into the water, after the mixture stands for a while, the oil separates from the water and rises to the top. You can see how oil floats on ocean water in the Figure 1.2.

1840,"Context: Antifreeze could also be called antiboil because it also raises the boiling point of the water in a car radiator. Hot weather combined with a hot engine can easily raise the temperature of the water in the radiator above 100  C, which is the boiling point of pure water. If the water boils, it could cause the engine to overheat and become seriously damaged. However, if antifreeze has been added to the water, the boiling point is much higher. For example a 50 percent antifreeze solution has a boiling point of 129  C. Unless the water gets hotter than this, it wont boil and ruin the engine.

1847,"Context: Ocean water normally dissolves some of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels has increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As a result, ocean water is also dissolving more carbon dioxide. When carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it forms a weak acid. With higher levels of dissolved carbon dioxide in ocean water, the water becomes more acidic. This process is called ocean acidification. Ocean acidification can kill some aquatic organisms, including corals and shellfish. It may make it more difficult for other aquatic organisms to reproduce. Both effects of acidification interfere with marine food webs, threatening the survival of many aquatic organisms.

1875,"Context: Certain factors can change the solubility of a solute. Temperature is one such factor. How temperature affects solubility depends on the state of the solute, as you can see in the Figure 1.1. If a solute is a solid or liquid, increasing the temperature increases its solubility. For example, more sugar can dissolve in hot water than in cold water. If a solute is a gas, increasing the temperature decreases its solubility. For example, less carbon dioxide can dissolve in warm water than in cold water. The solubility of gases is also affected by pressure. Pressure is the force pushing against a given area. Increasing the pressure on a gas increases its solubility. Did you ever open a can of soda and notice how it fizzes out of the can? Soda contains dissolved carbon dioxide. Opening the can reduces the pressure on the gas in solution, so it is less soluble. As a result, some of the carbon dioxide comes out of solution and rushes into the air. Q: Which do you think will fizz more when you open it, a can of warm soda or a can of cold soda? A: A can of warm soda will fizz more because increasing the temperature decreases the solubility of a gas. Therefore, less carbon dioxide can remain dissolved in warm soda than in cold soda. 
Question: Heating a liquid solute increases its solubility.

1876,"Context: What happens when you have become negatively charged and your hand approaches the metal doorknocker? Your negatively charged hand repels electrons in the metal, so the electrons move to the other side of the knocker. This makes the side of the knocker closest to your hand positively charged. As your negatively charged hand gets very close to the positively charged side of the metal, the air between your hand and the knocker also becomes electrically charged. This allows electrons to suddenly flow from your hand to the knocker. The sudden flow of electrons is static discharge. The discharge of electrons is the spark you see and the shock you feel. 
Question: If you get a shock when you touch a metal doorknob, static discharge has occurred.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
1877,"Context: Static electricity is a buildup of electric charges on objects. Charges build up when negative electrons are transferred from one object to another. The object that gives up electrons becomes positively charged, and the object that accepts the electrons becomes negatively charged. This can happen in several ways. One way electric charges can build up is through friction between materials that differ in their ability to give up or accept electrons. When you wipe your rubber-soled shoes on the wool mat, for example, electrons rub off the mat onto your shoes. As a result of this transfer of electrons, positive charges build up on the mat and negative charges build up on you. Once an object becomes electrically charged, it is likely to remain charged until it touches another object or at least comes very close to another object. Thats because electric charges cannot travel easily through air, especially if the air is dry. Q: Youre more likely to get a shock in the winter when the air is very dry. Can you explain why? A: When the air is very dry, electric charges are more likely to build up objects because they cannot travel easily through the dry air. This makes a shock more likely when you touch another object.

1878,"Context: Electric charge is a physical property of particles or objects that causes them to attract or repel each other without touching. All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton has a positive electric charge, and an electron has a negative electric charge. In the Figure 1.1, you can see that positively charged protons (+) are located in the nucleus of the atom, while negatively charged electrons (-) move around the nucleus.

1879,"Context: Another example of static discharge, but on a much larger scale, is lightning. You can see how it occurs in the following diagram (Figure 1.1). During a rainstorm, clouds develop regions of positive and negative charge due to the movement of air molecules, water drops, and ice particles. The negative charges are concentrated at the base of the clouds, and the positive charges are concentrated at the top. The negative charges repel electrons on the ground beneath them, so the ground below the clouds becomes positively charged. At first, the atmosphere prevents electrons from flowing away from areas of negative charge and toward areas of positive charge. As more charges build up, however, the air between the oppositely charged areas also becomes charged. When this happens, static electricity is discharged as bolts of lightning. 
Question: Both lightning bolts and electric current occur because of
Options:(A) polarization (B) static discharge (C) static electricity (D) moving electric charges
Answer:",D
1880,"Context: When it comes to electric charges, opposites attract, so positive and negative particles attract each other. You can see this in the Figure 1.2. This attraction explains why negative electrons keep moving around the positive nucleus of the atom. Like charges, on the other hand, repel each other, so two positive or two negative charges push apart. This is also shown in the diagram. The attraction or repulsion between charged particles is called electric force. The strength of electric force depends on the amount of electric charge on the particles and the distance between them. Larger charges or shorter distances result in greater force. Q: How do positive protons stay close together inside the nucleus of the atom if like charges repel each other? A: Other, stronger forces in the nucleus hold the protons together.

1882,"Context: Did you ever rub an inflated balloon against your hair? You can see what happens in the Figure 1.3. Friction between the balloon and hair cause electrons from the hair to rub off on the balloon. Thats because a balloon attracts electrons more strongly than hair does. After the transfer of electrons, the balloon becomes negatively charged and the hair becomes positively charged. The individual hairs push away from each other and stand on end because like charges repel each other. The balloon and the hair attract each other because opposite charges attract. Electrons are transferred in this way whenever there is friction between materials that differ in their ability to give up or accept electrons. Q: If you rub a balloon against a wall, it may stick to the wall. Explain why.

You can see how it happens in Figure 23.8. When the negatively charged plastic rod in the figure is placed close to the neutral metal plate, electrons in the plate are repelled by the positive charges in the rod. The electrons move away from the rod, causing one side of the plate to become positively charged and the other side to become negatively charged. Polarization may also occur after you walk across a wool carpet in rubber-soled shoes and become negatively charged.

1901,"Context: Particles of matter of the same substance, such as the same element, are attracted to one another. The force of attraction tends to pull the particles closer together. The particles need a lot of kinetic energy to overcome the force of attraction and move apart. Its like a tug of war between opposing forces. The kinetic energy of individual particles is on one side, and the force of attraction between different particles is on the other side. The outcome of the ""war"" depends on the state of matter. This is illustrated in Figure 4.8 and in the animation at this URL: http://w In solids, particles dont have enough kinetic energy to overcome the force of attraction between them. The particles are packed closely together and cannot move around. All they can do is vibrate. This explains why solids have a fixed volume and shape. In liquids, particles have enough kinetic energy to partly overcome the force of attraction between them. They can slide past one another but not pull completely apart. This explains why liquids can change shape but have a fixed volume. In gases, particles have a lot of kinetic energy. They can completely overcome the force of attraction between them and move apart. This explains why gases have neither a fixed volume nor a fixed shape.

Answer:",G
1903,"Context: Why do charges flow in an electric current? The answer has to do with electric potential energy. Potential energy is stored energy that an object has due to its position or shape. An electric charge has potential energy because of its position in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where their potential energy is lower. This is similar to water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity. In general, for an electric charge to move from one position to another, there must be a difference in electric potential energy between the two positions. The difference in electric potential energy is called potential difference, or voltage. Voltage is measured in an SI unit called the volt (V). For example, the terminals of the car battery in Figure 23.11 have a potential difference of 12 volts. This difference in voltage results in a spontaneous flow of charges, or electric current.

The battery in a car is a 12-volt battery. How do you think the current of a 12-volt battery compares to the current of a 1.5-volt battery? A: Greater voltage means a greater difference in potential energy, so the 12-volt battery can produce more current than the 1.5-volt battery.

1912,"Context: Chemical cells are found in batteries. They produce voltage by means of chemical reactions. A chemical cell has two electrodes, which are strips made of different materials, such as zinc and carbon (see Figure 23.12). The electrodes are suspended in an electrolyte. An electrolyte is a substance containing free ions that can carry electric current. The electrolyte may be either a paste, in which case the cell is called a dry cell, or a liquid, in which case the cell is called a wet cell. Flashlight batteries contain dry cells. Car batteries contain wet cells. Animations at the URL below show how batteries work. Both dry and wet cells work the same basic way. The electrodes react chemically with the electrolyte, causing one electrode to give up electrons and the other electrode to accept electrons. In the case of zinc and carbon electrodes, the zinc electrode attracts electrons and becomes negatively charged, while the carbon electrode gives up electrons and becomes positively charged. Electrons flow through the electrolyte from the negative to positive electrode. If wires are used to connect the two electrodes at their terminal ends, electric current will flow through the wires and can be used to power a light bulb or other electric device.

1923,"Context: An electric generator is a device that changes kinetic energy to electrical energy through electromagnetic induction. A simple diagram of an electric generator is shown in Figure 25.11. In a generator, some form of energy is applied to turn a shaft. This causes a coil of wire to rotate between opposite poles of a magnet. Because the coil is rotating in a magnetic field, electric current is generated in the wire. If the diagram in Figure 25.11 looks familiar to you, thats because a generator is an electric motor in reverse. Look back at the electric motor in Figure 25.8. If you were to mechanically turn the shaft of the motor (instead of using electromagnetism to turn it), the motor would generate electricity just like an electric generator. You can learn how to make a very simple electric generator by watching the video at the URL below. Making your own generator will help you understand how a generator works. Generators may be set up to produce either alternating or direct current. Generators in cars and most power plants produce alternating current. A car generator produces electricity with some of the kinetic energy of the turning crankshaft. The electricity is used to run the cars lights, power windows, radio, and other electric devices. Some of the electricity is stored in the cars battery to provide electrical energy when the car isnt running. A power plant generator produces electricity with the kinetic energy of a turning turbine. The energy to turn the turbine may come from burning fuel, falling water, or some other energy source. You can see how falling water is used to generate electricity in Figure 25.12 and in the video at this URL:

1924,"Context: How much resistance a material has depends on several factors: the type of material, its width, its length, and its temperature. All materials have some resistance, but certain materials resist the flow of electric current more or less than other materials do. Materials such as plastics have high resistance to electric current. They are called electric insulators. Materials such as metals have low resistance to electric current. They are called electric conductors. A wide wire has less resistance than a narrow wire of the same material. Electricity flowing through a wire is like water flowing through a hose. More water can flow through a wide hose than a narrow hose. In a similar way, more current can flow through a wide wire than a narrow wire. A longer wire has more resistance than a shorter wire. Current must travel farther through a longer wire, so there are more chances for it to collide with particles of matter. A cooler wire has less resistance than a warmer wire. Cooler particles have less kinetic energy, so they move more slowly. Therefore, they are less likely to collide with moving electrons in current. Materials called superconductors have virtually no resistance when they are cooled to extremely low temperatures.

In a home circuit, the source of voltage is an electric power plant, which may supply electric current to many homes and businesses in a community or even to many communities. The conductor in most circuits consists of one or more wires. The conductor must form a closed loop from the source of voltage and back again.

Then the energy used would be: Electrical Energy = 1.2 kilowatts 1 hour = 0.1 kilowatt-hours 12 Electrical energy use is typically expressed in kilowatt-hours, as in this example. How much energy is this? One kilowatt-hour equals 3.6 million joules of energy. Therefore, the 0.1 kilowatt-hours used by the microwave equals 0.36 million joules of energy. You Try It! Problem: A family watches television for an average of 2 hours per day. The television has 0.12 kilowatts of power. How much electrical energy does the family use watching television each day?

1951,"Context: The rate at which a device changes electric current to another form of energy is called electric power. The SI unit of powerincluding electric poweris the watt. A watt equals 1 joule of energy per second. High wattages are often expressed in kilowatts, where 1 kilowatt equals 1000 watts. The power of an electric device, such as a microwave, can be calculated if you know the current and voltage of the circuit. This equation shows how power, current, and voltage are related: Power (watts) = Current (amps)  Voltage (volts) Consider a microwave that is plugged into a home circuit. Assume the microwave is the only device connected to the circuit. If the voltage of the circuit is 120 volts and it carries 10 amps of current, then the power of the microwave is: Power = 120 volts  10 amps = 1200 watts, or 1.2 kilowatts You Try It!

1953,"Context: Because electricity can be so dangerous, safety features are built into electric circuits and devices. They include three-prong plugs, circuit breakers, and GFCI outlets. Each feature is described and illustrated in Table 23.1. You can learn more about electric safety features in the home by watching the video at this URL:  Electric Safety Feature Three-Prong Plug Circuit Breaker Description A three-prong plug is generally used on metal appli- ances. The two flat prongs carry current to and from the appliance. The round prong is for safety. It connects with a wire inside the outlet that goes down into the ground. If any stray current leaks from the circuit or if there is a short circuit, the ground wire carries the current into the ground, which harmlessly absorbs it. A circuit breaker is a switch that automatically opens a circuit if too much current flows through it. This could happen if too many electric devices are plugged into the circuit or if there is an electric short. Once the problem is resolved, the circuit breaker can be switched back on to close the circuit. Circuit breakers are generally found in a breaker box that controls all the circuits in a building. Electric Safety Feature GFCI Outlet Description GFCI stands for ground-fault circuit interrupter. GFCI outlets are typically found in bathrooms and kitchens where the use of water poses a risk of shock (because water is a good electric conductor). A GFCI outlet contains a device that monitors the amounts of current leaving and returning to the outlet. If less current is returning than leaving, this means that current is escaping. When this occurs, a tiny circuit breaker in the outlet opens the circuit. The breaker can be reset by pushing a button on the outlet cover.

1954,"Context: Even with electric safety features, electricity is still dangerous if it is not used safely. Follow the safety rules below to reduce the risk of injury or fire from electricity. Never mix electricity and water. Dont turn on or plug in electric lights or appliances when your hands are wet, you are standing in water, or you are in the shower or bathtub. The current could flow through the waterand youbecause water is a very good electric conductor. Never overload circuits. Avoid plugging too many devices into one outlet or extension cord. The more devices that are plugged in, the more current the circuit carries. Too much current can overheat a circuit and start a fire. Never use devices with damaged cords or plugs. They can cause shocks, shorts, and fires. Never put anything except plugs into electric outlets. Plugging in other objects is likely to cause a serious shock that could be fatal. Never go near fallen electric lines. They could be carrying a lot of current. Report fallen lines to the electric company as soon as possible.

1958,"Context: All electric circuits have at least two parts: a voltage source and a conductor. The voltage source of the circuit in Figure 23.16 is a battery. In a home circuit, the source of voltage is an electric power plant, which may supply electric current to many homes and businesses in a community or even to many communities. The conductor in most circuits consists of one or more wires. The conductor must form a closed loop from the source of voltage and back again. In Figure 23.16, the wires are connected to both terminals of the battery, so they form a closed loop. The circuit in Figure 23.16 also has two other parts: a light bulb and a switch. Most circuits have devices such as light bulbs that convert electric energy to other forms of energy. In the case of a light bulb, electricity is converted to light and thermal energy. Many circuits have switches to control the flow of current through the circuit. When the switch is turned on, the circuit is closed and current can flow through it.

1988,"Context: Some materials resist the flow of electric current more or less than other materials do. Materials that have low resistance to electric current are called electric conductors. Many metalsincluding copper, aluminum, and steelare good conductors of electricity. Water that has even a tiny amount of impurities in it is an electric conductor as well. Materials that have high resistance to electric current are called electric insulators. Wood, rubber, and plastic are examples of electric insulators. Dry air is also an electric insulator. You probably know that electric wires are made of metal and coated with rubber or plastic (see Figure 23.14). Now you know why. Metals are good electric conductors, so they offer little resistance and allow most of the current to pass through. Rubber and plastic are good insulators, so they offer a lot of resistance and allow little current to pass through. When more than one material is available for electric current to flow through, the current always travels through the material with the least resistance. Thats why all the current passes through a metal wire and none flows through its rubber or plastic coating.

The 1s and 0s are the letters of the code, and a huge number of them are needed. One digit (either 0 or 1) is called a bit, which stands for binary digit. Each group of eight digits is called a byte, and a billion bytes is called a gigabyte. Because a computers circuits are so tiny and close together, the computer can be very fast and capable of many complex tasks while remaining small. The parts of a computer that transmit, process, or store digital signals are pictured and described in the Figure 1.1. They include the CPU, hard drive, ROM, and RAM. The motherboard ties all these parts of the computer together. The CPU, or central processing unit, carries out program instructions. The hard drive is a magnetic disc that provides long-term storage for programs and data. ROM (read-only memory) is a microchip that provides permanent storage. It stores important information such as start-up instructions. This memory remains even after the computer is turned off. RAM (random-access memory) is a microchip that temporarily stores programs and data that are currently being used. Anything stored in RAM is lost when the computer is turned off. The motherboard is connected to the CPU, hard drive, ROM, and RAM. It allows all these parts of the computer to receive power and communicate with one another. Q: Which part(s) of a computer are you using when you type a school report? A: You are using the RAM to store the word processing program and your document as you type it. You are using the CPU to carry out instructions in the word processing program, and you are probably using the hard drive to save your document.

1992,"Context: Did you ever make a secret code? One way to make a code is to represent each letter of the alphabet by a different number. Then you can send a coded message by writing words as strings of digits. This is similar to how information is encoded using an electric current. The voltage of the current is changed rapidly and repeatedly to encode a message, called an electronic signal. There are two different types of electronic signals: analog signals and digital signals. Both are illustrated in Figure 23.20. A digital signal consists of pulses of voltage, created by repeatedly switching the current off and on. This type of signal encodes information as a string of 0s (current off) and 1s (current on). This is called a binary (""two-digit"") code. DVDs, for example, encode sounds and pictures as digital signals. An analog signal consists of continuously changing voltage in a circuit. For example, microphones encode sounds as analog signals.

1996,"Context: A semiconductor is a solid crystal, consisting mainly of silicon. It gets its name from the fact that it can conduct current better than an electric insulator but not as well as an electric conductor. As you can see in the Figure 1.1, each silicon atom has four valence electrons that it shares with other silicon atoms in the crystal. A semiconductor is formed by replacing a few silicon atoms with other atoms, such as phosphorus or boron, which have more or less valence electrons than silicon. This is called doping, and its what allows the semiconductor to conduct electric current. Q: Why wouldnt a pure silicon crystal be able to conduct electric current? A: Electric current is a flow of electrons. All of the valence electrons of silicon atoms in a pure crystal are shared with other silicon atoms, so they are not free to move and carry current. There are two different types of semiconductors: n-type and p-type. An n-type (negative-type) semiconductor consists of silicon and an element such as phosphorus that gives the silicon crystal extra electrons. You can see this in the Figure 1.1. An n-type semiconductor is like the negative terminal of a battery. A p-type (positive-type) semiconductor consists of silicon and an element such as boron that gives the silicon positively charged holes where electrons are missing. This is also shown in the Figure 1.1. A p-type semiconductor is like the positive terminal of a battery.

1997,"Context: Electronic components contain many semiconductors. Types of components include diodes, transistors, and inte- grated circuits. Each type is described in Table 23.2. Electronic Component Diode Transistor Integrated Circuit (Microchip) Description A diode consists of a p-type and an n-type semicon- ductor placed side by side. When a diode is connected by leads to a source of voltage, electrons flow from the n-type to the p-type semiconductor. This is the only direction that electrons can flow in a diode. This makes a diode useful for changing alternating current to direct current. A transistor consists of three semiconductors, either p- n-p or n-p-n. Current cant flow through a transistor unless a small amount of current is applied to the center semiconductor (through the base). Then a much larger current can flow through the transistor from end to end (from collector to emitter). This means that a transmitter can be used as a switch, with pulses of a small current turning a larger current on and off. A transistor can also be used to increase the amount of current flowing through a circuit.

2011,"Context: In 1820, a physicist in Denmark, named Hans Christian Oersted, discovered how electric currents and magnetic fields are related. However, it was just a lucky accident. Oersted, who is pictured in Figure 25.1, was presenting a demonstration to his students. Ironically, he was trying to show that electricity and magnetism are not related. He placed a wire with electric current flowing through it next to a magnet, and nothing happened. After class, a student held the wire near the magnet again, but in a different direction. To Oersteds surprise, the pointer of the magnet swung toward the wire so it was no longer pointing to Earths magnetic north pole. Oersted was intrigued. He turned off the current in the wire to see what would happen to the magnet. The pointer swung back to its original position, pointing north again. Oersted had discovered that an electric current creates a magnetic field. The magnetic field created by the current was strong enough to attract the pointer of the nearby compass. Oersted wanted to learn more about the magnetic field created by a current, so he placed a magnet at different locations around a wire with current flowing through it.

2025,"Context: The magnetic field created by a current flowing through a wire actually surrounds the wire in concentric circles. This magnetic field is stronger if more current is flowing through the wire. The direction of the magnetic field also depends on the direction that the current is flowing through the wire. A simple rule, called the right hand rule, makes it easy to find the direction of the magnetic field if the direction of the current is known. The right hand rule is illustrated in Figure 25.3. When the thumb of the right hand is pointing in the same direction as the current, the fingers of the right hand curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field.

2030,"Context: In 1820, Oersted was presenting a demonstration to some science students. Ironically, he was trying to show them that electricity and magnetism are not related. He placed a wire with electric current flowing through it next to a compass, which has a magnetic needle. As he expected, the needle of the compass didnt move. It just kept pointing toward Earths north magnetic pole. After the demonstration, a curious student held the wire near the compass again, but in a different direction. To Oersteds surprise, the needle of the compass swung toward the wire so it was no longer pointing north. Oersted was intrigued. He turned off the current in the wire to see what would happen to the compass needle. The needle swung back to its original position, pointing north once again. Oersted had discovered that an electric current creates a magnetic field. The magnetic field created by the current was strong enough to attract the needle of the nearby compass.

2031,"Context: Although a compass always points north, it doesnt point to Earths geographic north pole, which is located at 90 north latitude (see Figure 24.11). Instead, it points to Earths magnetic north pole, which is located at about 80 north latitude. Earths magnetic south pole is also located several degrees of latitude away from the geographic south pole. A compass pointer has north and south poles, and its north pole points to Earths magnetic north pole. Why does this happen if opposite poles attract? Why doesnt the compass needle point south instead? The answer may surprise you. Earths magnetic north pole is actually the south pole of magnet Earth! Its called the magnetic north pole to avoid confusion. Because its close to the geographic north pole, it would be confusing to call it the magnetic south pole.

The rotating shaft moves other parts of the device. For example, in an electric fan, the rotating shaft turns the blades of the fan. Why does the motors electromagnet rotate? The electromagnet is located between the north and south poles of two permanent magnets. When current flows through the electromagnet, it becomes magnetized, and its poles are repelled by the like poles of the permanent magnets. This causes the electromagnet to rotate toward the unlike poles of the permanent magnets. A device called a commutator then changes the direction of the current so the poles of the electromagnet are reversed. The reversed poles are again repelled by the poles of the permanent magnets, which have not reversed. This causes the electromagnet to continue to rotate. These events keep repeating, so the electromagnet rotates continuously.

When current flows through the circuit, the electromagnet turns on, and its magnetic field attracts the clapper. This causes the clapper to hit the bell, making it ring. Because the clapper is part of the circuit, when it moves to strike the bell, it breaks the circuit. Without current flowing through the circuit, the electromagnet turns off. The clapper returns to its original position, which closes the circuit again and turns the electromagnet back on. The electromagnet again attracts the clapper, which hits the bell once more.

2064,"Context: An electromagnet is a solenoid wrapped around a bar of iron or other ferromagnetic material. A solenoid is a coil of wire with electric current flowing through it. This gives the coil north and south magnetic poles and a magnetic field. The magnetic field of the solenoid magnetizes the iron bar by aligning its magnetic domains. You can see this in the Figure 1.1. 
Question: An electromagnet contains a solenoid.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
2065,"Context: A solenoid is a coil of wire with electric current flowing through it, giving it a magnetic field (see Figure 25.5). Recall that current flowing through a straight wire produces a weak electromagnetic field that circles around the wire. Current flowing through a coil of wire, in contrast, produces a magnetic field that has north and south poles like a bar magnet. The magnetic field around a coiled wire is also stronger than the magnetic field around a straight wire because each turn of the wire has its own magnetic field. Adding more turns increases the strength of the field, as does increasing the amount of current flowing through the coil. You can see an actual solenoid with a compass showing its magnetic north pole at this URL:  .

2067,"Context: Figure 25.7 shows a diagram of a simple doorbell. Like most doorbells, it has a button located by the front door. Pressing the button causes two electric contacts to come together and complete an electric circuit. In other words, the button is a switch. The circuit is also connected to a voltage source, an electromagnet, and the clapper of a bell. When current flows through the circuit, the electromagnet turns on, and its magnetic field attracts the clapper. This causes the clapper to hit the bell, making it ring. Because the clapper is part of the circuit, when it moves to strike the bell, it breaks the circuit. Without current flowing through the circuit, the electromagnet turns off. The clapper returns to its original position, which closes the circuit again and turns the electromagnet back on. The electromagnet again attracts the clapper, which hits the bell once more. This sequence of events keeps repeating as long as the button by the front door is being pressed.

2069,"Context: An electric motor is a device that uses an electromagnet to change electrical energy to kinetic energy. You can see a simple diagram of an electric motor in the Figure 1.2. The motor contains an electromagnet that is connected to a shaft. When current flows through the motor, the electromagnet rotates, causing the shaft to rotate as well. The rotating shaft moves other parts of the device. For example, in an electric fan, the rotating shaft turns the blades of the fan. Why does the motors electromagnet rotate? The electromagnet is located between the north and south poles of two permanent magnets. When current flows through the electromagnet, it becomes magnetized, and its poles are repelled by the like poles of the permanent magnets. This causes the electromagnet to rotate toward the unlike poles of the permanent magnets. A device called a commutator then changes the direction of the current so the poles of the electromagnet are reversed. The reversed poles are again repelled by the poles of the permanent magnets, which have not reversed. This causes the electromagnet to continue to rotate.

2072,"Context: The magnetic field created by a current flowing through a wire actually surrounds the wire in concentric circles. This magnetic field is stronger if more current is flowing through the wire. The direction of the magnetic field also depends on the direction that the current is flowing through the wire. A simple rule, called the right hand rule, makes it easy to find the direction of the magnetic field if the direction of the current is known. The right hand rule is illustrated in Figure 25.3. When the thumb of the right hand is pointing in the same direction as the current, the fingers of the right hand curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field.

2098,"Context: The device in the circuit in Figure 25.9 is an ammeter. It measures the current that flows through the wire. The faster the magnet or coil moves, the greater the amount of current that is produced. If more turns were added to the coil, this would increase the strength of the magnetic field as well. If the magnet were moved back and forth repeatedly, the current would keep changing direction. In other words, alternating current would be produced. This is illustrated in Figure 25.10.

2099,"Context: Electromagnetic induction is the process of generating electric current with a magnetic field. It occurs whenever a magnetic field and an electric conductor, such as a coil of wire, move relative to one another. As long as the conductor is part of a closed circuit, current will flow through it whenever it crosses lines of force in the magnetic field. One way this can happen is illustrated in the Figure 1.1. The sketch shows a magnet moving through a wire coil. Q: What is another way that a coil of wire and magnet can move relative to one another and generate an electric current? A: The coil of wire could be moved back and forth over the magnet.

2101,"Context: The device with the pointer in the Figure 1.1 is an ammeter. It measures the current that flows through the wire. The faster the magnet or coil moves, the greater the amount of current that is produced. If more turns were added to the coil or a stronger magnet were used, this would produce more current as well. The Figure 1.2 shows the direction of the current that is generated by a moving magnet. If the magnet is moved back and forth repeatedly, the current keeps changing direction. In other words, alternating current (AC) is produced. Alternating current is electric current that keeps reversing direction.

2103,"Context: An electric generator is a device that changes kinetic energy to electrical energy through electromagnetic induction. A simple diagram of an electric generator is shown in Figure 25.11. In a generator, some form of energy is applied to turn a shaft. This causes a coil of wire to rotate between opposite poles of a magnet. Because the coil is rotating in a magnetic field, electric current is generated in the wire. If the diagram in Figure 25.11 looks familiar to you, thats because a generator is an electric motor in reverse. Look back at the electric motor in Figure 25.8. If you were to mechanically turn the shaft of the motor (instead of using electromagnetism to turn it), the motor would generate electricity just like an electric generator. You can learn how to make a very simple electric generator by watching the video at the URL below. Making your own generator will help you understand how a generator works. Generators may be set up to produce either alternating or direct current. Generators in cars and most power plants produce alternating current. A car generator produces electricity with some of the kinetic energy of the turning crankshaft. The electricity is used to run the cars lights, power windows, radio, and other electric devices. Some of the electricity is stored in the cars battery to provide electrical energy when the car isnt running. A power plant generator produces electricity with the kinetic energy of a turning turbine. The energy to turn the turbine may come from burning fuel, falling water, or some other energy source. You can see how falling water is used to generate electricity in Figure 25.12 and in the video at this URL:

Answer:",A
2104,"Context: An electric transformer is a device that uses electromagnetic induction to change the voltage of electric current. A transformer may either increase or decrease voltage, but it only works with alternating current. You can see the components of an electric transformer in Figure 25.13. As you can see in Figure 25.13, a transformer consists of two wire coils wrapped around an iron core. When alternating primary current passes through coil P, it magnetizes the iron core. Because the current is alternating, the magnetic field of the iron core keeps reversing. This changing magnetic field induces alternating current in coil S, which is part of another circuit. In Figure 25.13, coil P and coil S have the same number of turns of wire. In this case, the voltages of the primary and secondary currents are the same. However, when the two coils have different numbers of turns, the voltage of the secondary current is different than the voltage of the primary current. Both cases are illustrated in Figure 25.14. When coil S has more turns of wire than coil P, the voltage in the secondary current is greater than the voltage in the primary current. This type of transformer is called a step-up transformer. When coil S has fewer turns of wire than coil P, the voltage in the secondary current is less than the voltage in the primary current. This type of transformer is called a step-down transformer. For an animation of a transformer, go to this URL:  . 
Question: When alternating current flows through coil P of an electric transformer, it

Answer:",B
2105,"Context: Power plant generators produce high-voltage electric current. Many power plants also use step-up transformers to increase the voltage of the current even more (see Figure 25.15). By increasing the voltage, the amount of current is decreased, so less power is lost as the electricity travels through the power lines. However, the voltage in power lines is too high to be safe for home circuits. The voltage in power lines may be as great as 750,000 volts, whereas most home circuits are 240 or 120 volts. One or more step-down transformers decrease the voltage of current before it enters the home. Other step-down transformers within the home lower the voltage of some of the homes circuits.

Solution: D = 20 g/10 mL = 2.0 g/mL You Try It! Problem: An object has a mass of 180 kg and a volume of 90 m3 . What is its density? To better understand density, think about a bowling ball and a volleyball. The bowling ball feels heavy. It is solid all the way through. It contains a lot of tightly packed particles of matter. In contrast, the volleyball feels light. It is full of air. It contains fewer, more widely spaced particles of matter. Both balls have about the same volume, but the bowling ball has a much greater mass. Its matter is denser.

2113,"Context: Weight measures the force of gravity pulling on an object. Because weight measures force, the SI unit for weight is the newton (N). On Earth, a mass of 1 kilogram has a weight of about 10 newtons because of the pull of Earths gravity On the moon, which has less gravity, the same mass would weigh less. Weight is measured with a scale, like the spring scale in Figure 13.16. The scale measures the force with which gravity pulls an object downward.

2114,"Context: Imagine a container of gas molecules like the one in the Figure 1.1. The container in the sketch has a lid that can be pushed down to shrink the volume of the gas inside. Notice what happens as the lid is lowered. The gas molecules crowd closer together because there is less space for them to occupy and they have nowhere else to go. Gas molecules have a lot of energy. They are always moving and bouncing off each other and anything else in their path. When gas molecules bump into things, it creates pressure. Pressure is greater when gas molecules occupy a smaller space, because the greater crowding results in more collisions. In other words, decreasing the volume of a gas increases its pressure.

2115,"Context: Volume is a measure of the amount of space that a substance or an object takes up. The basic SI unit for volume is the cubic meter (m3 ), but smaller volumes may be measured in cm3 , and liquids may be measured in liters (L) or milliliters (mL). How the volume of matter is measured depends on its state. The volume of a liquid is measured with a measuring container, such as a measuring cup or graduated cylinder. The volume of a gas depends on the volume of its container: gases expand to fill whatever space is available to them. The volume of a regularly shaped solid can be calculated from its dimensions. For example, the volume of a rectangular solid is the product of its length, width, and height. The volume of an irregularly shaped solid can be measured by the displacement method. You can read below how this method works. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Q: How could you find the volume of air in an otherwise empty room? A: If the room has a regular shape, you could calculate its volume from its dimensions. For example, the volume of a rectangular room can be calculated with the formula: Volume = length  width  height If the length of the room is 5.0 meters, the width is 3.0 meters, and the height is 2.5 meters, then the volume of the room is: Volume = 5.0 m  3.0 m  2.5 m = 37.5 m3 Q: What is the volume of the dinosaur in the diagram above? A: The volume of the water alone is 4.8 mL. The volume of the water and dinosaur together is 5.6 mL. Therefore, the volume of the dinosaur alone is 5.6 mL - 4.8 mL = 0.8 mL.

2117,"Context: The amount of space matter takes up is its volume. How the volume of matter is measured depends on its state. The volume of liquids is measured with measuring containers. In the kitchen, liquid volume is usually measured with measuring cups or spoons. In the lab, liquid volume is measured with containers such as graduated cylinders. Units in the metric system for liquid volume include liters (L) and milliliters (mL). The volume of gases depends on the volume of their container. Thats because gases expand to fill whatever space is available to them. For example, as you drink water from a bottle, air rushes in to take the place of the water. An ""empty"" liter bottle actually holds a liter of air. How could you find the volume of air in an ""empty"" room? The volume of regularly shaped solids can be calculated from their dimensions. For example, the volume of a rectangular solid is the product of its length, width, and height (l x w x h). For solids that have irregular shapes, the displacement method is used. You can see how it works in the video below. The SI unit for solid volumes is cubic meters (m3 ). However, cubic centimeters (cm3 ) are often used for smaller volume measurements. The displacement method is used to find the volume of irregularly shaped objects. It measures the amount of water that the object displaces, or moves out of the way.

2118,"Context: Density is mass per unit volume. Density is a measure of how closely molecules are packed together. The closer together they are, the greater the density. Since air is a gas, the molecules can pack tightly or spread out. The density of air varies from place to place. Air density depends on several factors. One is temperature. Like other materials, warm air is less dense than cool air. Since warmer molecules have more energy, they are more active. The molecules bounce off each other and spread apart. Another factor that affects the density of air is altitude.

2119,"Context: In addition to these properties, other physical properties of matter include the state of matter. States of matter include liquid, solid, and gaseous states. For example at 20 C, coal exists as a solid and water exists as a liquid. Additional examples of physical properties include: odor boiling point ability to conduct heat ability to conduct electricity ability to dissolve in other substances Some of these properties are illustrated in the Figures 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  The strong smell of swimming pool water is the odor of chlorine, which is added to the water to kill germs and algae. In con- trast, bottled spring water, which contains no chlorine, does not have an odor. Coolant is added to the water in a car radiator to keep the water from boiling and evaporating. Coolant has a higher boiling point than water and adding it to the water increases the boiling point of the solution. Q: The coolant that is added to a car radiator also has a lower freezing point than water. Why is this physical property useful? A: When coolant is added to water in a car radiator, it lowers the freezing point of the water. This prevents the water in the radiator from freezing when the temperature drops below 0 C, which is the freezing point of pure water. Q: Besides being able to conduct electricity, what other physical property of copper makes it well suited for electric wires? A: Copper, like other metals, is ductile. This means that it can be rolled and stretched into long thin shapes such as wires. This teakettle is made of aluminum except for its handle, which is made of plastic. Aluminum is a good conductor of heat. It conducts heat from the flames on the range to the water inside the kettle, so the water heats quickly. Plastic, on the other hand, is not a good conductor of heat. It stays cool enough to touch even when the rest of the teakettle becomes very hot.

For example, the water in a drinking glass has the same density as the water in the same volume of a swimming pool. Gold has a density of about 19 g/cm3 ; pyrite has a density of about 5 g/cm3 - thats another way to tell pyrite from gold. Quartz is even less dense than pyrite and has a density of 2.7 g/cm3 .

It shows that when wood burns, it combines with oxygen and changes not only to ashes but also to carbon dioxide and water vapor. The gases float off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Suppose you had measured the mass of the wood before it burned and the mass of the ashes after it burned. Also suppose you had been able to measure the oxygen used by the fire and the gases produced by the fire. What would you find? The total mass of matter after the fire would be the same as the total mass of matter before the fire. Q: What can you infer from this example? A: You can infer that burning does not destroy matter.

To use this type of balance, follow these steps: 1. Place the object to be measured on the pan at the left side of the balance. 2. Slide the movable masses to the right until the right end of the arm is level with the balance mark. Start by moving the larger masses and then fine tune the measurement by moving the smaller masses as needed. 3. Read the three scales to determine the values of the masses that were moved to the right. Their combined mass is equal to the mass of the object. The Figure 1.2 is an enlarged version of the scales of the triple beam balance in Figure 1.1. It allows you to read the scales. The middle scale, which measures the largest movable mass, reads 300 grams. This is followed by the top scale, which reads 30 grams. The bottom scale reads 5.1 grams. Therefore, the mass of the object in the pan is 335.1 grams (300 grams + 30 grams + 5.1 grams). Q: What is the maximum mass this triple beam balance can measure? A: The maximum mass it can measure is 610 grams (500 grams + 100 grams + 10 grams). Q: What is the smallest mass this triple beam balance can measure? A: The smallest mass it can measure is one-tenth (0.1) of a gram. To measure very small masses, scientists use electronic balances, like the one in the Figure 1.3. This type of balance also makes it easier to make accurate measurements because mass is shown as a digital readout. In the picture, the balance is being used to measure the mass of a white powder on a plastic weighing tray. The mass of the tray alone would have to be measured first and then subtracted from the mass of the tray and powder together. The difference between the two masses is the mass of the powder alone.

2160,"Context: The process in which rocks or other solids change to liquids is called melting. Melting occurs when particles of a solid absorb enough energy to partly overcome the force of attraction holding them together. This allows them to move out of their fixed positions and slip over one another. Melting, like other changes of state, is a physical change in matter, so it doesnt change the chemical makeup or chemical properties of matter. Q: The molten rock that erupts from a volcano comes from deep underground. How is this related to its liquid state? A: It is always very hot deep underground where molten rock originates. The high temperatures give rock enough energy to melt and remain in a molten state. Underground rock in this state is called magma. Q: What happens to magma after it erupts and starts flowing over the surface of the ground? A: After magma erupts, it is called lava. On the surface, lava eventually cools and hardens to form solid rock. Other substances that are normally solids on Earth can also be heated until they melt. You can see an example in the Figure 1.1.

2178,"Context: Energy is the ability to cause changes in matter. For example, your body uses chemical energy when you lift your arm or take a step. In both cases, energy is used to move matteryou. Any matter that is moving has energy just because its moving. The energy of moving matter is called kinetic energy. Scientists think that the particles of all matter are in constant motion. In other words, the particles of matter have kinetic energy. The theory that all matter consists of constantly moving particles is called the kinetic theory of matter. 
Question: energy that moves matter

Answer:",E
2179,"Context: There is another factor that affects the rate of dissolving. The particle size of solute particles affects the rate. Smaller particles have greater surface area. Think of a large block of Legos. When all the blocks are stuck together you can measure their surface area. Now take all the blocks apart and measure their individual surface areas. Which has more? Greater surface area provides more contact between the particles and the solvent. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of iced tea, it will dissolve more quickly. If you put a sugar cube in a glass of iced tea, it will dissolve more slowly. Thats because all those tiny particles of granulated sugar have greater surface area than a single sugar cube.

2183,"Context: Youre probably less familiar with plasmas than with solids, liquids, and gases. Yet, most of the universe consists of plasma. Plasma is a state of matter that resembles a gas but has certain properties that a gas does not have. Like a gas, plasma lacks a fixed volume and shape. Unlike a gas, plasma can conduct electricity and respond to magnetism. Thats because plasma contains charged particles called ions. This gives plasma other interesting properties. For example, it glows with light. Where can you find plasmas? Two examples are shown in Figure 4.7. The sun and other stars consist of plasma.

2186,"Context: Energy is always involved in changes of state. Matter either loses or absorbs energy when it changes from one state to another. For example, when matter changes from a liquid to a solid, it loses energy. The opposite happens when matter changes from a solid to a liquid. For a solid to change to a liquid, matter must absorb energy from its surroundings. The amount of energy in matter can be measured with a thermometer.

2189,"Context: Particles of matter of the same substance, such as the same element, are attracted to one another. The force of attraction tends to pull the particles closer together. The particles need a lot of kinetic energy to overcome the force of attraction and move apart. Its like a tug of war between opposing forces. The kinetic energy of individual particles is on one side, and the force of attraction between different particles is on the other side. The outcome of the ""war"" depends on the state of matter. This is illustrated in Figure 4.8 and in the animation at this URL: http://w In solids, particles dont have enough kinetic energy to overcome the force of attraction between them. The particles are packed closely together and cannot move around. All they can do is vibrate. This explains why solids have a fixed volume and shape. In liquids, particles have enough kinetic energy to partly overcome the force of attraction between them. They can slide past one another but not pull completely apart. This explains why liquids can change shape but have a fixed volume. In gases, particles have a lot of kinetic energy. They can completely overcome the force of attraction between them and move apart.

2198,"Context: The amount of space matter takes up is its volume. How the volume of matter is measured depends on its state. The volume of liquids is measured with measuring containers. In the kitchen, liquid volume is usually measured with measuring cups or spoons. In the lab, liquid volume is measured with containers such as graduated cylinders. Units in the metric system for liquid volume include liters (L) and milliliters (mL). The volume of gases depends on the volume of their container. Thats because gases expand to fill whatever space is available to them. For example, as you drink water from a bottle, air rushes in to take the place of the water. An ""empty"" liter bottle actually holds a liter of air. How could you find the volume of air in an ""empty"" room? The volume of regularly shaped solids can be calculated from their dimensions. For example, the volume of a rectangular solid is the product of its length, width, and height (l x w x h). For solids that have irregular shapes, the displacement method is used. You can see how it works in the video below. The SI unit for solid volumes is cubic meters (m3 ). However, cubic centimeters (cm3 ) are often used for smaller volume measurements. The displacement method is used to find the volume of irregularly shaped objects. It measures the amount of water that the object displaces, or moves out of the way.

2211,"Context: Water changes to a gas by three different processes called evaporation, sublimation, and transpiration. Evaporation takes place when water on Earths surface changes to water vapor. The sun heats the water and gives water molecules enough energy to escape into the atmosphere. Most evaporation occurs from the surface of the ocean. Sublimation takes place when snow and ice on Earths surface change directly to water vapor without first melting to form liquid water. This also happens because of heat from the sun. Transpiration takes place when plants release water vapor through pores in their leaves called stomata.

Another example of liquid water changing to solid ice is pictured in Figure 4.19. The process in which a liquid changes to a solid is called freezing. The temperature at which a liquid changes to a solid is its freezing point. The freezing point of water is 0C (32F). Other types of matter may have higher or lower freezing points.

This happens as particles of liquid water gain enough energy to completely overcome the force of attraction between them and change to the gaseous state. The bubbles rise through the water and escape from the pot as steam. The process in which a liquid boils and changes to a gas is called vaporization. The temperature at which a liquid boils is its boiling point. The boiling point of water is 100C (212F). Other types of matter may have higher or lower boiling points. For example, the boiling point of table salt is 1413C. The boiling point of nitrogen is -196C.

2248,"Context: Steam actually consists of tiny droplets of liquid water. What you cant see in the picture is the water vapor that is also present in the air above the spring. Water vapor is water in the gaseous state. It constantly rises up from the surface of boiling hot water. Why? At high temperatures, particles of a liquid gain enough energy to completely overcome the force of attraction between them, so they change to a gas. The gas forms bubbles that rise to the surface of the liquid because gas is less dense than liquid. The bubbling up of the liquid is called boiling. When the bubbles reach the surface, the gas escapes into the air. The entire process in which a liquid boils and changes to a gas that escapes into the air is called vaporization. Q: Why does steam form over the hot spring pictured above? A: Steam forms when some of the water vapor from the boiling water cools in the air and condenses to form droplets of liquid water.

2255,"Context: The amount of space matter takes up is its volume. How the volume of matter is measured depends on its state. The volume of liquids is measured with measuring containers. In the kitchen, liquid volume is usually measured with measuring cups or spoons. In the lab, liquid volume is measured with containers such as graduated cylinders. Units in the metric system for liquid volume include liters (L) and milliliters (mL). The volume of gases depends on the volume of their container. Thats because gases expand to fill whatever space is available to them. For example, as you drink water from a bottle, air rushes in to take the place of the water. An ""empty"" liter bottle actually holds a liter of air. How could you find the volume of air in an ""empty"" room? The volume of regularly shaped solids can be calculated from their dimensions. For example, the volume of a rectangular solid is the product of its length, width, and height (l x w x h). For solids that have irregular shapes, the displacement method is used. You can see how it works in the video below. The SI unit for solid volumes is cubic meters (m3 ). However, cubic centimeters (cm3 ) are often used for smaller volume measurements. The displacement method is used to find the volume of irregularly shaped objects. It measures the amount of water that the object displaces, or moves out of the way. What is the volume of the toy dinosaur in mL? [See Figure ??] Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Q: How could you find the volume of air in an otherwise empty room? A: If the room has a regular shape, you could calculate its volume from its dimensions. For example, the volume of a rectangular room can be calculated with this formula: Volume = length  width  height If the length of the room is 5.0 meters, the width is 3.0 meters, and the height is 2.5 meters, then the volume of the room is: Volume = 5.0 m  3.0 m  2.5 m = 37.5 m3 Q: What is the volume of the dinosaur in the diagram above? A: The volume of the water alone is 4.8 mL. The volume of the water and dinosaur together is 5.6 mL. Therefore, the volume of the dinosaur alone is 5.6 mL - 4.8 mL = 0.8 mL.

Options:(A) chemical reactions (B) solar energy (C) electric current (D) none of the above
Answer:",A
2266,"Context: Chemical cells are found in batteries. They produce voltage by means of chemical reactions. Chemical cells have two electrodes, which are strips of different materials, such as zinc and carbon. The electrodes are suspended in an electrolyte. This is a substance that contains free ions, which can carry electric current. The electrolyte may be either a paste, in which case the cell is called a dry cell, or a liquid, in which case the cell is called a wet cell. Flashlight batteries contain dry cells. Car batteries contain wet cells. The Figure 1.1 shows how a battery works. The diagram represents the simplest type of battery, one that contains a single chemical cell. Both dry and wet cells work the same basic way. The electrodes react chemically with the electrolyte, causing one electrode to give up electrons and the other electrode to accept electrons. Electrons flow through the electrolyte from the negative to positive electrode. The electrodes extend out of the battery for the attachment of wires that carry the current. The current can be used to power a light bulb or other electric device. 
Question: a car battery is a dry cell.

Answer:",B
2267,"Context: Chemical cells are found in batteries. They produce voltage by means of chemical reactions. A chemical cell has two electrodes, which are strips made of different materials, such as zinc and carbon (see Figure 23.12). The electrodes are suspended in an electrolyte. An electrolyte is a substance containing free ions that can carry electric current. The electrolyte may be either a paste, in which case the cell is called a dry cell, or a liquid, in which case the cell is called a wet cell. Flashlight batteries contain dry cells. Car batteries contain wet cells. Animations at the URL below show how batteries work. Both dry and wet cells work the same basic way. The electrodes react chemically with the electrolyte, causing one electrode to give up electrons and the other electrode to accept electrons. In the case of zinc and carbon electrodes, the zinc electrode attracts electrons and becomes negatively charged, while the carbon electrode gives up electrons and becomes positively charged. Electrons flow through the electrolyte from the negative to positive electrode. If wires are used to connect the two electrodes at their terminal ends, electric current will flow through the wires and can be used to power a light bulb or other electric device. 
Question: which statement about how a chemical cell works is false?
Options:(A) The electrodes react chemically with the electrolyte (B) Both electrodes give up electrons (C) Electrons flow through the electrolyte (D) One electrode is negative and one is positive
Answer:",B
2268,"Context: A chemical change occurs whenever matter changes into an entirely different substance with different chemical properties. A chemical change is also called a chemical reaction. Many complex chemical changes occur to produce the explosions of fireworks. An example of a simpler chemical change is the burning of methane. Methane is the main component of natural gas, which is burned in many home furnaces. During burning, methane combines with oxygen in the air to produce entirely different chemical substances, including the gases carbon dioxide and water vapor.

Question: a chemical change always involves one or more
Options:(A) chemical reactions (B) chemical properties (C) states of matter (D) two of the above
Answer:",D
2269,"Context: Some properties of matter can be measured or observed only when matter undergoes a change to become an entirely different substance. These properties are called chemical properties. They include flammability and reactivity. 
Question: an example of a property that could change only if a chemical change occurs is

Answer:",D
2270,"Context: A physical change in matter is a change in one or more of matters physical properties. Glass breaking is just one example of a physical change. Some other examples are shown in Figure 3.16 and in the video below. In each example, matter may look different after the change occurs, but its still the same substance with the same chemical properties. For example, smaller pieces of wood have the ability to burn just as larger logs do. MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Because the type of matter remains the same with physical changes, the changes are often easy to undo. For example, braided hair can be unbraided again. Melted chocolate can be put in a fridge to re-harden. Dissolving salt in water is also a physical change. How do you think you could undo it? 
Question: ice melting is an example of a chemical change in matter.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
2271,"Context: A change in color is just one of several potential signs that a chemical reaction has occurred. Other potential signs include: Change in temperature-Heat is released or absorbed during the reaction. Production of a gas-Gas bubbles are released during the reaction. Production of a solid-A solid settles out of a liquid solution. The solid is called a precipitate. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: 
Question: signs that a chemical change has occurred include
Options:(A) a change in color (B) the release of bubbles (C) the production of an odor (D) all of the above
Answer:",D
2272,"Context: Most chemical changes are not as dramatic as exploding fireworks, so how can you tell whether a chemical change has occurred? There are usually clues. You just need to know what to look for. A chemical change has probably occurred if bubbles are released, there is a change of color, or an odor is produced. Other clues include the release of heat, light, or loud sounds. Examples of chemical changes that produce these clues are shown in the Figure 1.1. Q: In addition to iron rusting, what is another example of matter changing color? Do you think this color change is a sign that a new chemical substance has been produced? A: Another example of matter changing color is a penny changing from reddish brown to greenish brown as it becomes tarnished. The color change indicates that a new chemical substance has been produced. Copper on the surface of the penny has combined with oxygen in the air to produce a different substance called copper oxide. Q: Besides food spoiling, what is another change that produces an odor? Is this a chemical change? A: When wood burns, it produces a smoky odor. Burning is a chemical change. Q: Which signs of chemical change do fireworks produce? A: Fireworks produce heat, light, and loud sounds. These are all signs of chemical change.

2274,"Context: Reactivity is the ability of matter to combine chemically with other substances. For example, iron is highly reactive with oxygen. When it combines with oxygen, it forms the reddish powder called rust (see Figure 3.6). Rust is not iron but an entirely different substance that consists of both iron and oxygen. 
Question: which metal has the ability to rust?
Options:(A) gold (B) copper (C) iron (D) aluminum
Answer:",C
2275,"Context: Hydrogen is a very reactive gas, and the alkali metals are even more reactive. In fact, they are the most reactive metals and, along with the elements in group 17, are the most reactive of all elements. The reactivity of alkali metals increases from the top to the bottom of the group, so lithium (Li) is the least reactive alkali metal and francium (Fr) is the most reactive. Because alkali metals are so reactive, they are found in nature only in combination with other elements. They often combine with group 17 elements, which are very eager to gain an electron.

2277,"Context: Chemical properties are properties that can be measured or observed only when matter undergoes a change to become an entirely different kind of matter. For example, the ability of iron to rust can only be observed when iron actually rusts. When it does, it combines with oxygen to become a different substance called iron oxide. Iron is very hard and silver in color, whereas iron oxide is flakey and reddish brown. Besides the ability to rust, other chemical properties include reactivity and flammability. 
Question: rust has the same properties as iron.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
2278,"Context: Have you ever seen a symbol that says ""Flammable""? You might see such a symbol on a gasoline can. Gasoline is highly flammable. That is why there are signs at the gas station that say, ""NO SMOKING."" Flammability is the ability of matter to burn. When matter burns, it combines with oxygen. When it does, it changes to different substances. Wood is an example of flammable matter, as seen in Figure 1.1. Q: How can you tell that wood ashes are a different substance than wood? A: Ashes have different properties than wood. For example, ashes are gray and powdery. Wood is brown and hard. Q: What are some other substances that have the property of flammability? A: Substances called fuels have the property of flammability. They include fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas, and petroleum. For example, gasoline is used in our cars because it is flammable. This property enables car engines to run. Substances made of wood, such as paper and cardboard, are also flammable. 
Question: which of these substances is least flammable?
Options:(A) cardboard (B) paper (C) charcoal (D) steel
Answer:",D
2279,"Context: When air is very humid, it doesnt have to cool very much for water vapor in the air to start condensing. The temperature at which condensation occurs is called the dew point. The dew point varies depending on air temperature and moisture content. It is always less than or equal to the actual air temperature, but warmer air and moister air have dew points closer to the actual air temperature. Thats why glasses of cold drinks sweat more on a hot, humid day than they do on a cool, dry day. Q: What happens when air temperature reaches the dew point? A: When air temperature reaches the dew point, water vapor starts condensing. It may form dew (as on the spider web in the opening image), clouds, or fog. Dew forms on solid objects on the ground. Clouds form on tiny particles in the air high above the ground. Fog is a cloud that forms on tiny particles in the air close to the ground. 
Question: the dew point depends on the
Options:(A) speed of the wind (B) temperature of the air (C) amount of moisture in the air (D) two of the above

Question: the dew point is always less than or equal to the air temperature.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
2281,"Context: Humidity usually refers to relative humidity. This is the percent of water vapor in the air relative to the total amount the air can hold. How much water vapor can the air hold? That depends on temperature. Warm air can hold more water vapor than cool air. You can see this in Figure 16.1. 
Question: warmer air can hold more water vapor than cooler air.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
2282,"Context: Rising air currents carry water vapor into the atmosphere. As the water vapor rises in the atmosphere, it cools and condenses. Condensation is the process in which water vapor changes to tiny droplets of liquid water. The water droplets may form clouds. If the droplets get big enough, they fall as precipitation. Precipitation is any form of water that falls from the atmosphere. It includes rain, snow, sleet, hail, and freezing rain. Most precipitation falls into the ocean. Eventually, this water evaporates again and repeats the water cycle. Some frozen precipitation becomes part of ice caps and glaciers. These masses of ice can store frozen water for hundreds of years or even longer. Condensation may also form fog or dew. Some living things, like the lizard in Figure 24.8, depend directly on these sources of liquid water. 
Question: condensation is responsible for forming
Options:(A) dew (B) fog (C) clouds (D) all of the above
Answer:",D
2283,"Context: Clouds form when water vapor condenses around particles in the air. The particles are specks of matter, such as dust or smoke. Billions of these tiny water droplets come together to make up a cloud. If the air is very cold, ice crystals form instead of liquid water. 
Question: clouds consist of large masses of water vapor.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
2284,"Context: This burning campfire example illustrates a very important law in science: the law of conservation of mass. This law states that matter cannot be created or destroyed. Even when matter goes through a physical or chemical change, the total mass of matter always remains the same. Q: How could you show that the mass of matter remains the same when matter changes state? A: You could find the mass of a quantity of liquid water. Then you could freeze the water and find the mass of the ice. The mass before and after freezing would be the same, showing that mass is conserved when matter changes state. 
Question: mass is conserved in physical but not chemical changes in matter.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
2285,"Context: If you build a campfire, like the one in Figure 3.19, you start with a large stack of sticks and logs. As the fire burns, the stack slowly shrinks. By the end of the evening, all thats left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the flames? It may seem that way, but in fact, the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Assume you had measured the mass of the wood before you burned it. Assume you had also trapped the gases released by the burning wood and measured their mass and the mass of the ashes. What would you find? The ashes and gases combined have the same mass as the wood you started with. This example illustrates the law of conservation of mass. The law states that matter cannot be created or destroyed. Even when matter goes through physical or chemical changes, the total mass of matter always remains the same. (In the chapter Nuclear Chemistry, you will learn about nuclear reactions, in which mass is converted into energy. But other than that, the law of conservation of mass holds.) For a fun challenge, try to apply the law of conservation of mass to a scene from a Harry Potter film at this link:  . 
Question: when you burn a candle, all that remains is a small puddle of wax. the puddle of wax has less mass than the original candle. the rest of the original candles mass was
Options:(A) destroyed (B) changed to gases (C) measured incorrectly (D) none of the above
Answer:",B
2286,"Context: If you have a mass of 50 kg on Earth, what is your weight in newtons? An object with more mass is pulled by gravity with greater force. Mass and weight are closely related. However, the weight of an object can change if the force of gravity changes. On Earth, the force of gravity is the same everywhere. So how does the force of gravity change? It doesnt if you stay on Earth. What if we travel to another planet or moon in our solar system? Look at the photo of astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. taken by fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong in the Figure ??. They were the first humans to walk on the moon. An astronaut weighs less on the moon than he would on Earth. This is because the moons gravity is weaker than Earths. The astronauts mass, on the other hand, did not change. He still contained the same amount of matter on the moon as he did on Earth. If the astronaut weighed 175 pounds on Earth, he would have weighed only 29 pounds on the moon. If his mass on Earth was 80 kg, what would his mass have been on the moon? [Figure 3] 
Question: an astronaut weighs much less on the moon than on earth because he has much less mass on the moon.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
2287,"Context: It may seem as though burning destroys matter, but the same amount, or mass, of matter still exists after a campfire as before. Look at the sketch in Figure 1.1. It shows that when wood burns, it combines with oxygen and changes not only to ashes but also to carbon dioxide and water vapor. The gases float off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Suppose you had measured the mass of the wood before it burned and the mass of the ashes after it burned. Also suppose you had been able to measure the oxygen used by the fire and the gases produced by the fire. What would you find? The total mass of matter after the fire would be the same as the total mass of matter before the fire. Q: What can you infer from this example? A: You can infer that burning does not destroy matter. It just changes matter into different substances. 
Question: fire destroys the mass of the fuel that it burns.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
2288,"Context: Why must chemical equations be balanced? Its the law! Matter cannot be created or destroyed in chemical reactions. This is the law of conservation of mass. In every chemical reaction, the same mass of matter must end up in the products as started in the reactants. Balanced chemical equations show that mass is conserved in chemical reactions. 
Question: the products of a chemical reaction can never have greater mass than the reactants.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
2289,"Context: Density, or the amount of mass in a given volume, is also related to the ability of an object to float. Thats because density affects weight. A given volume of a denser substance is heavier than the same volume of a less dense substance. For example, ice is less dense than liquid water. This explains why the giant ice berg in the Figure 1.3 is floating in the ocean. Q: Can you think of more examples of substances that float in a fluid because they are low in density? A: Oil is less dense than water, so oil from a spill floats on ocean water. Helium is less dense than air, so balloons filled with helium float in air. 
Question: helium has greater density than air.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
2290,"Context: Density is an important physical property of matter. It reflects how closely packed the particles of matter are. Density is calculated from the amount of mass in a given volume of matter, using the formula: Density (D) = Mass (M) Volume (V ) Problem Solving Problem: What is the density of a substance that has a mass of 20 g and a volume of 10 mL? Solution: D = 20 g/10 mL = 2.0 g/mL You Try It! Problem: An object has a mass of 180 kg and a volume of 90 m3 . What is its density? To better understand density, think about a bowling ball and a volleyball. The bowling ball feels heavy. It is solid all the way through. It contains a lot of tightly packed particles of matter. In contrast, the volleyball feels light. It is full of air. It contains fewer, more widely spaced particles of matter. Both balls have about the same volume, but the bowling ball has a much greater mass. Its matter is denser. 
Question: density is a chemical property of matter.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
2291,"Context: Density is also an important physical property of matter. The concept of density combines what we know about an objects mass and volume. Density reflects how closely packed the particles of matter are. When particles are packed together more tightly, matter is more dense. Differences in density of matter explain many phenomena. It explains why helium balloons rise. It explains why currents such as the Gulf Stream flow through the oceans. It explains why some things float in or sink. You can see this in action by pouring vegetable oil into water. You can see a colorful demonstration in this video. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  To better understand density, think about a bowling ball and volleyball, pictured in the Figure 1.1. Imagine lifting each ball. The two balls have about the same volume. The bowling ball feels much heavier than the volleyball, but why? It is because the bowling ball is made of solid plastic. Plastic contains a lot of tightly packed particles of matter. In contrast, the volleyball is full of a gas (air). The air atoms are further apart than in the solid bowling ball. Therefore, the matter inside the bowling ball is more dense than the matter inside the volleyball. Q: If you ever went bowling, you may have noticed that all the bowling balls are the same size. This means they have the same volume. Even though they are the same size, some bowling balls feel heavier than others. How can this be? A: Bowling balls that feel lighter are made of matter that is less dense. 
Question: if two objects have the same density, they must have the same
Options:(A) mass (B) volume (C) weight (D) none of the above
Answer:",D
2292,"Context: The density of matter is actually the amount of matter in a given space. The amount of matter is measured by its mass. The space matter takes up is measured by its volume. Therefore, the density of matter can be calculated with this formula: Density = mass volume Assume, for example, that a book has a mass of 500 g and a volume of 1000 cm3 . Then the density of the book is: Density = 500 g = 0.5 g/cm3 1000 cm3 Q: What is the density of a liquid that has a volume of 30 mL and a mass of 300 g? A: The density of the liquid is: Density = 300 g = 10 g/mL 30 mL 
Question: if a 60-g object has a volume of 30 cm3, what is its density?
Options:(A) 2 g/cm3 (B) 05 cm3/g (C) 1800 g ∙ cm3 (D) none of the above

2293,"Context: Some precipitation forms in place. Dew forms when moist air cools below its dew point on a cold surface. Frost is dew that forms when the air temperature is below freezing. 
Question: conditions required for frost to form on the ground include
Options:(A) air that is warm and moist (B) ground that is freezing cold (C) ground that is warmer than air (D) two of the above
Answer:",D
2294,"Context: Deposition as a change of state often occurs in nature. For example, when warm moist air comes into contact with very cold surfacessuch as the ground or objects on the groundice crystals are deposited on them. These ice crystals are commonly called frost. Look at the dead leaf and blades of grass in the Figure 1.1. They are covered with frost. If you look closely, you can see the individual crystals of ice. You can watch a demonstration of frost forming on the side of a very cold can at the URL below. (Click on the mulitmedia choice Ice on a Can.). The ice in the can has been cooled to a very low temperature by adding salt to it. Q: In places with very cold winters, why might frost be more likely to form on the ground in the fall than in the winter? A: Frost forms when the air is warmer than the ground. This is more likely to be the case in the fall. In the winter, the air is likely to be as cold as the ground. Deposition also occurs high above the ground when water vapor in the air changes to ice crystals. In the atmosphere, the ice crystals are deposited on tiny dust particles. These ice crystals form clouds, generally cirrus clouds, which are thin and wispy. You can see cirrus clouds in the Figure 1.2. Q: Cirrus clouds form only at altitudes of 6 kilometers or higher above sea level. Do you know why? A: At this altitude, the atmosphere is always very cold. Unless the air is cold, water vapor will condense to form water droplets instead of ice crystals. 
Question: frost is most likely to form in winter than fall.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
2295,"Context: Several processes are involved in common changes of state. They include melting, freezing, sublimation, deposition, condensation, and evaporation. The Figure 1.1 shows how matter changes in each of these processes. Q: Which two processes result in matter changing to the solid state? A: The processes are deposition, in which matter changes from a gas to a solid, and freezing, in which matter changes from a liquid to a solid.

Answer:",A
2303,"Context: Magnetism produced by electricity is called electromagnetism. Today, electromagnetism is used in many electric devices. However, until electromagnetism was discovered, scientists thought that electricity and magnetism were unrelated. A Danish scientist named Hans Christian Oersted (pictured in the Figure 1.1) changed all that. He made the important discovery that electric current creates a magnetic field. But like many other important discoveries in science, Oersteds discovery was just a lucky accident.

Answer:",C
2304,"Context: Just about a decade after Oersted discovered that electric current can produce a magnetic field, an English scientist named Michael Faraday discovered that the opposite is also true. A magnetic field can produce an electric current. This is known as Faradays law. The process by which a magnetic field produces current is called electromagnetic induction. It occurs when a conductor, such as a wire, crosses lines of force in a magnetic field. This can happen when a wire is moving relative to a magnet or a magnet is moving relative to a wire.

2307,"Context: Electromagnetism is used not only in a doorbells but in many other electric devices as well, such as electric motors and loudspeakers. It is also used to store information on computer disks. An important medical use of electromagnetism is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This is a technique for making images of the inside of the body in order to diagnose diseases or injuries. Magnetism created with electric current is so useful because it can be turned on or off simply by turning the current on or off. The strength of the magnetic field is also easy to control by changing the amount of current. You cant do either of these things with a regular magnet.

2308,"Context: Electric charge is a physical property of particles or objects that causes them to attract or repel each other without touching. All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton has a positive electric charge, and an electron has a negative electric charge. In the Figure 1.1, you can see that positively charged protons (+) are located in the nucleus of the atom, while negatively charged electrons (-) move around the nucleus.

2310,"Context: All protons are identical. For example, hydrogen protons are exactly the same as protons of helium and all other elements, or pure substances. However, atoms of different elements have different numbers of protons. In fact, atoms of any given element have a unique number of protons that is different from the numbers of protons of all other elements. For example, a hydrogen atom has just one proton, whereas a helium atom has two protons. The number of protons in an atom determines the electrical charge of the nucleus. The nucleus also contains neutrons, but they are neutral in charge. The one proton in a hydrogen nucleus, for example, gives it a charge of +1, and the two protons in a helium nucleus give it a charge of +2.

2313,"Context: Electric charge is a physical property of particles or objects that causes them to attract or repel each other without touching. All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton has a positive electric charge, and an electron has a negative electric charge (see Figure 23.2). When it comes to electric charges, opposites attract. In other words, positive and negative particles are attracted to each other. Like charges, on the other hand, repel each other, so two positive or two negative charges push apart from each other. The force of attraction or repulsion between charged particles is called electric force. It is illustrated in Figure 23.3. The strength of electric force depends on the amount of electric charge and the distance between the charged particles. The larger the charge or the closer together the charges are, the greater is the electric force.

2317,"Context: All electric circuits have at least two parts: a voltage source and a conductor. They may have other parts as well, such as light bulbs and switches, as in the simple circuit seen in the Figure 1.1. The voltage source of this simple circuit is a battery. In a home circuit, the source of voltage is an electric power plant, which may supply electric current to many homes and businesses in a community or even to many communities. The conductor in most circuits consists of one or more wires. The conductor must form a closed loop from the source of voltage and back again. In the Figure 1.1, the wires are connected to both terminals of the battery, so they form a closed loop. Most circuits have devices such as light bulbs that convert electrical energy to other forms of energy. In the case of a light bulb, electrical energy is converted to light and thermal energy. Many circuits have switches to control the flow of current. When the switch is turned on, the circuit is closed and current can flow through it.

Materials that have high resistance to electric current are called electric insulators. Wood, rubber, and plastic are examples of electric insulators. Dry air is also an electric insulator. You probably know that electric wires are made of metal and coated with rubber or plastic (see Figure 23.14). Now you know why. Metals are good electric conductors, so they offer little resistance and allow most of the current to pass through. Rubber and plastic are good insulators, so they offer a lot of resistance and allow little current to pass through. When more than one material is available for electric current to flow through, the current always travels through the material with the least resistance. Thats why all the current passes through a metal wire and none flows through its rubber or plastic coating.

2327,"Context: Electric potential energy comes from the position of a charged particle in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges actually move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where they have lower potential energy. This is like water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity. 
Question: electric charges always move from a position of lower potential energy to a position of higher potential energy.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
2328,"Context: Why do charges flow in an electric current? The answer has to do with electric potential energy. Potential energy is stored energy that an object has due to its position or shape. An electric charge has potential energy because of its position in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where their potential energy is lower. This is similar to water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity. In general, for an electric charge to move from one position to another, there must be a difference in electric potential energy between the two positions. The difference in electric potential energy is called potential difference, or voltage. Voltage is measured in an SI unit called the volt (V). For example, the terminals of the car battery in Figure 23.11 have a potential difference of 12 volts. This difference in voltage results in a spontaneous flow of charges, or electric current.

The SI unit of resistance is the ohm (named for the scientist Georg Ohm, whom you can read about below). Resistance is caused by electrons in a current bumping into electrons and ions in the matter through which the current is flowing. Resistance is similar to the friction that resists the movement of one surface as it slides over another. Resistance reduces the amount of current that can travel through the material because some of the electrical energy is converted to other forms of energy.

Thats because some of the electrical energy is absorbed by the atoms and changed to other forms of energy, such as heat. Q: In the rugby analogy to resistance in physics, what do the players on each team represent? A: The player on the blue and black team represents a moving electron in an electric current. The players on the red and blue team represent particles of matter through which the current is flowing. 
Question: resistance reduces the amount of electrical energy that is transferred through matter.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
2347,"Context: How much resistance a material has depends on several factors: the type of material, its width, its length, and its temperature. All materials have some resistance, but certain materials resist the flow of electric current more or less than other materials do. Materials such as plastics have high resistance to electric current. They are called electric insulators. Materials such as metals have low resistance to electric current. They are called electric conductors. A wide wire has less resistance than a narrow wire of the same material. Electricity flowing through a wire is like water flowing through a hose. More water can flow through a wide hose than a narrow hose. In a similar way, more current can flow through a wide wire than a narrow wire. A longer wire has more resistance than a shorter wire. Current must travel farther through a longer wire, so there are more chances for it to collide with particles of matter. A cooler wire has less resistance than a warmer wire. Cooler particles have less kinetic energy, so they move more slowly. Therefore, they are less likely to collide with moving electrons in current. Materials called superconductors have virtually no resistance when they are cooled to extremely low temperatures. 
Question: all materials have some electric resistance.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
2348,"Context: For a given material, three properties of the material determine how resistant it is to electric current: length, width, and temperature. Consider an electric wire like one of the wires in Figure 23.14. A longer wire has more resistance. Current must travel farther, so there are more chances for it to collide with particles of wire. A wider wire has less resistance. A given amount of current has more room to flow through a wider wire. A cooler wire has less resistance than a warmer wire. Cooler particles have less kinetic energy, so they move more slowly. Current is less likely to collide with slowly moving particles. Materials called superconductors have virtually no resistance when they are cooled to extremely low temperatures.

2351,"Context: An electric cord contains two wires. One wire carries current from the outlet to the appliance or other electric device, and one wire carries current back to the outlet. Did you ever see an old appliance with a damaged cord, like the one in Figure 23.19? A damaged electric cord can cause a severe shock if it allows current to pass from the cord to a person who touches it. A damaged cord can also cause a short circuit. A short circuit occurs when electric current follows a shorter path than the intended loop of the circuit. For example, if the two wires in a damaged cord come into contact with each other, current flows from one wire to the other and bypasses the appliance. This may cause the wires to overheat and start a fire. 
Question: why does the cord of an electric device contain two electric wires?
Options:(A) The two wires make up the two loops of a parallel circuit (B) One wire carries direct current and one wire carries alternating current (C) One wire carries current to the device and one wire carries current away from the device (D) two of the above
Answer:",C
2352,"Context: Because electricity can be so dangerous, safety features are built into electric circuits and devices. They include three-prong plugs, circuit breakers, and GFCI outlets. Each feature is described and illustrated in Table 23.1. You can learn more about electric safety features in the home by watching the video at this URL:  Electric Safety Feature Three-Prong Plug Circuit Breaker Description A three-prong plug is generally used on metal appli- ances. The two flat prongs carry current to and from the appliance. The round prong is for safety. It connects with a wire inside the outlet that goes down into the ground. If any stray current leaks from the circuit or if there is a short circuit, the ground wire carries the current into the ground, which harmlessly absorbs it. A circuit breaker is a switch that automatically opens a circuit if too much current flows through it. This could happen if too many electric devices are plugged into the circuit or if there is an electric short. Once the problem is resolved, the circuit breaker can be switched back on to close the circuit. Circuit breakers are generally found in a breaker box that controls all the circuits in a building. Electric Safety Feature GFCI Outlet Description GFCI stands for ground-fault circuit interrupter. GFCI outlets are typically found in bathrooms and kitchens where the use of water poses a risk of shock (because water is a good electric conductor). A GFCI outlet contains a device that monitors the amounts of current leaving and returning to the outlet. If less current is returning than leaving, this means that current is escaping. When this occurs, a tiny circuit breaker in the outlet opens the circuit. The breaker can be reset by pushing a button on the outlet cover. 
Question: what is the purpose of the round prong on a three-prong plug?
Options:(A) It carries any stray electric current into the ground (B) It carries electric current to the appliance (C) It carries electric current away from the appliance (D) none of the above
Answer:",A
2353,"Context: Even with electric safety features, electricity is still dangerous if it is misused. Follow the safety rules below to reduce the risk of injury or fire from electricity. Never mix electricity and water. Dont plug in or turn on electric lights or appliances when your hands are wet, you are standing in water, or you are in the shower or bathtub. The current could flow through the waterand youbecause water is a good conductor of electricity. Never overload circuits. Avoid plugging too many devices into one outlet or extension cord. The more devices that are plugged in, the more current the circuit carries. Too much current can overheat a circuit and start a fire. Never use devices with damaged cords or plugs. They can cause shocks, shorts, and fires. Never put anything except plugs into electric outlets. Putting any other object into an outlet is likely to cause a serious shock that could be fatal. Never go near fallen electric lines. They could have very high voltage. Report fallen lines to the electric company as soon as possible.

2354,"Context: Power plant generators produce high-voltage electric current. Many power plants also use step-up transformers to increase the voltage of the current even more (see Figure 25.15). By increasing the voltage, the amount of current is decreased, so less power is lost as the electricity travels through the power lines. However, the voltage in power lines is too high to be safe for home circuits. The voltage in power lines may be as great as 750,000 volts, whereas most home circuits are 240 or 120 volts. One or more step-down transformers decrease the voltage of current before it enters the home. Other step-down transformers within the home lower the voltage of some of the homes circuits.

Answer:",B
2355,"Context: Electric substations have several functions. Many substations distribute electricity from a few high-voltage lines to several lower-voltage lines. They have electric transformers, which use electromagnetic induction to change the voltage of the current. Some transformers increase the voltage; others decrease the voltage. In the Figure 1.2, you can see how both types of transformers are used in an electrical grid. A step-up transformer increases the voltage of the current as it leaves the power plant. After the voltage has been increased, less current travels through the high-voltage power lines. This reduces the amount of power that is lost due to resistance of the power lines. A step-down transformer decreases the voltage of the current so it can be distributed safely to businesses and homes. A high-voltage power line may have 750,000 volts, whereas most home circuits have a maximum of 240 volts. Therefore, one or more step-down transformers are needed to decrease the voltage of current before it enters homes. Q: Assume that a home needs a 14-volt circuit for a light and a 120-volt circuit for a microwave oven. If the main power line entering home has 240 volts, what can you infer about the homes electrical system? A: The homes electrical system must have step-down transformers that lower the voltage for some of the homes circuits.

2365,"Context: A solenoid is a coil of wire with electric current flowing through it, giving it a magnetic field (see Figure 25.5). Recall that current flowing through a straight wire produces a weak electromagnetic field that circles around the wire. Current flowing through a coil of wire, in contrast, produces a magnetic field that has north and south poles like a bar magnet. The magnetic field around a coiled wire is also stronger than the magnetic field around a straight wire because each turn of the wire has its own magnetic field. Adding more turns increases the strength of the field, as does increasing the amount of current flowing through the coil.

An n-type semiconductor is like the negative terminal in a chemical cell. A p-type semiconductor consists of silicon and an element such as boron that gives the silicon positively charged holes where electrons are missing. A p-type semiconductor is like the positive terminal in a chemical cell.

2387,"Context: A diode is an electronic component that consists of a p-type and an n-type semiconductor placed side by side, as shown in the Figure 1.2. When a diode is connected by leads to a source of voltage, electrons flow from the n-type to the p-type semiconductor. This is the only direction that electrons can flow in a diode. This makes a diode useful for changing alternating current to direct current.

2390,"Context: Did you ever make a secret code? One way to make a code is to represent each letter of the alphabet by a different number. Then you can send a coded message by writing words as strings of digits. This is similar to how information is encoded using an electric current. The voltage of the current is changed rapidly and repeatedly to encode a message, called an electronic signal. There are two different types of electronic signals: analog signals and digital signals. Both are illustrated in Figure 23.20. A digital signal consists of pulses of voltage, created by repeatedly switching the current off and on. This type of signal encodes information as a string of 0s (current off) and 1s (current on). This is called a binary (""two-digit"") code. DVDs, for example, encode sounds and pictures as digital signals. An analog signal consists of continuously changing voltage in a circuit. For example, microphones encode sounds as analog signals.

A computer contains integrated circuits, or microchips, that consist of millions of tiny electronic components. Information is encoded in digital electronic signals. Rapid pulses of voltage switch electric current on and off, producing long strings of 1s (current on) and 0s (current off). The 1s and 0s are the letters of the code, and a huge number of them are needed. One digit (either 0 or 1) is called a bit, which stands for binary digit. Each group of eight digits is called a byte, and a billion bytes is called a gigabyte.

2394,"Context: For an electric charge to move from one position to another, there must be a difference in electric potential energy between the two positions. A difference in electric potential energy is called voltage. The SI unit for voltage is the volt (V). Look at the Figure 1.1. It shows a simple circuit. The source of voltage in the circuit is a 1.5-volt battery. The difference of 1.5 volts between the two battery terminals results in a spontaneous flow of charges, or electric current, between them. Notice that the current flows from the negative terminal to the positive terminal, because electric current is a flow of electrons. Q: You might put a 1.5-volt battery in a TV remote. The battery in a car is a 12-volt battery. How do you think the current of a 12-volt battery compares to the current of a 1.5-volt battery? A: Greater voltage means a greater difference in potential energy, so the 12-volt battery can produce more current than the 1.5-volt battery.

2407,"Context: A gas is one of four well-known states of matter. (The other three are solid, liquid, and plasma). The particles of a gas can pull apart from each other and spread out. As a result, a gas does not have a fixed shape or a fixed volume. In fact, a gas always spreads out to take up whatever space is available to it. If a gas is enclosed in a container, it spreads out until it has the same volume as the container. Q: The sketches in the Figure 1.1 represent two identical sealed boxes that contain only air particles (represented by dots). There are more air particles in box B than box A. Which box contains a greater volume of air? A: This is a trick question! The air inside each box expands to fill the available space, which is identical for both boxes.

2415,"Context: If you took ice cubes out of a freezer and left them in a warm room, the ice would absorb energy from the warmer air around it. The energy would allow the particles of frozen water to overcome some of the forces of attraction holding them together. They would be able to slip out of the fixed positions they held as ice. In this way, the solid ice would turn to liquid water. The process in which a solid changes to a liquid is called melting. The melting point is the temperature at which a solid changes to a liquid.

The salt will no longer be visible in the water, and it wont settle to the bottom of the glass. Colloids A colloid is a homogeneous mixture with medium- sized particles. The particles are large enough to see but not large enough to settle or be filtered out of the mixture. The gelatin in this dish is a colloid. It looks red because you can see the red gelatin particles in the mixture. However, the particles are too small to settle to the bottom of the dish. A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture with large particles. The particles are large enough to see and also to settle or be filtered out of the mixture. The salad dressing in this bottle is a suspension. It contains oil, vinegar, herbs, and spices. If the bottle sits undisturbed for very long, the mixture will separate into its component parts. Thats why you should shake it before you use it. Suspensions Q: If you buy a can of paint at a paint store, a store employee may put the can on a shaker machine to mix up the paint in the can. What type of mixture is the paint? A: The paint is a suspension. Some of the components of the paint settle out of the mixture when it sits undisturbed for a long time. This explains why you need to shake (or stir) the paint before you use it. Q: The milk you buy in the supermarket has gone through a process called homogenization. This process breaks up the cream in the milk into smaller particles. As a result, the cream doesnt separate out of the milk no matter how long it sits on the shelf. Which type of mixture is homogenized milk? A: Homogenized milk is a colloid. The particles in the milk are large enough to seethats why milk is white instead of clear like water, which is the main component of milk. However, the particles are not large enough to settle out of the mixture. 
Question: a colloid is a heterogeneous mixture.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
2424,"Context: The components of a mixture keep their own identity when they combine. Therefore, they usually can be easily separated again. Their different physical properties are used to separate them. For example, oil is less dense than water, so a mixture of oil and water can be separated by letting it stand until the oil floats to the top.

2426,"Context: For electric current to flow through a wire, there must be a source of voltage. Voltage is a difference in electric potential energy. As you might have guessed, greater voltage results in more current. As electric current flows through matter, particles of matter resist the moving charges. This is called resistance, and greater resistance results in less current. These relationships between electric current, voltage, and resistance were first demonstrated in the early 1800s by a German scientist named Georg Ohm, so they are referred to as Ohms law. Ohms law can be represented by the following equation. Current(amps) = Voltage(volts) Resistance(ohms)

2431,"Context: Not all changes in matter involve chemical reactions. For example, there are no chemical reactions involved in changes of state. When liquid water freezes or evaporates, it is still water. No bonds are broken and no new products are formed. How can you tell whether a change in matter involves a chemical reaction? Often, there is evidence. Four common signs that a chemical reaction has occurred are: Change in color: the products are a different color than the reactants. Change in temperature: heat is released or absorbed during the reaction. Production of a gas: gas bubbles are released during the reaction. Production of a solid: a solid settles out of a liquid solution. The solid is called a precipitate.

2462,"Context: Solubility is the amount of solute that can dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a given temperature. In a solution, the solute is the substance that dissolves, and the solvent is the substance that does the dissolving. For a given solvent, some solutes have greater solubility than others. For example, sugar is much more soluble in water than is salt. But even sugar has an upper limit on how much can dissolve. In a half liter of 20  C water, the maximum amount is 1000 grams. If you add more sugar than this, the extra sugar wont dissolve. You can compare the solubility of sugar, salt, and some other solutes in the Table 1.1.

If you add more than 2000 grams of sugar to a liter of 20  C water, the extra sugar wont dissolve. On the other hand, a solution containing less than 2000 g of sugar in 1 liter of 20  C water can hold more sugar. A solution that contains less solute than can dissolve at a given temperature is called an unsaturated solution. You can learn more about saturated and unsaturated solutions by watching the video at this URL:  .

2464,"Context: The Figure 1.1 shows the amounts of several different solutes that will dissolve in a liter of water at 20  C. As you can see from the graph, solutes vary greatly in how soluble they are in water. For example, you can dissolve almost 20 times as much sugar as baking soda in the same amount of water at this temperature. Q: Assume that a solution contains 150 grams of Epsom salt in 1 liter of water at 20  C. Is the solution saturated or unsaturated? A: A saturated solution of Epsom salt in 1 liter of 20  C water would contain 250 grams of Epsom salt. Therefore, this solution is unsaturated. It can hold another 100 grams of Epsom salt. Q: What do you think would happen if you added more than 250 grams of Epsom salt to a liter of 20  C water? A: Any Epsom salt over 250 grams would not dissolve in the solution.

2468,"Context: Ocean water is an example of a liquid. A liquid is matter that has a fixed volume but not a fixed shape. Instead, a liquid takes the shape of its container. If the volume of a liquid is less than the volume of its container, the top surface will be exposed to the air, like the oil in the bottles in Figure 4.4. Two interesting properties of liquids are surface tension and viscosity. Surface tension is a force that pulls particles at the exposed surface of a liquid toward other liquid particles. Surface tension explains why water forms droplets, like those in Figure 4.5. Viscosity is a liquids resistance to flowing. Thicker liquids are more viscous than thinner liquids. For example, the honey in Figure 4.5 is more viscous than the vinegar.

2469,"Context: Volume is a measure of the amount of space that a substance or an object takes up. The basic SI unit for volume is the cubic meter (m3 ), but smaller volumes may be measured in cm3 , and liquids may be measured in liters (L) or milliliters (mL). How the volume of matter is measured depends on its state. The volume of a liquid is measured with a measuring container, such as a measuring cup or graduated cylinder. The volume of a gas depends on the volume of its container: gases expand to fill whatever space is available to them. The volume of a regularly shaped solid can be calculated from its dimensions. For example, the volume of a rectangular solid is the product of its length, width, and height. The volume of an irregularly shaped solid can be measured by the displacement method. You can read below how this method works. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Q: How could you find the volume of air in an otherwise empty room? A: If the room has a regular shape, you could calculate its volume from its dimensions. For example, the volume of a rectangular room can be calculated with the formula: Volume = length  width  height If the length of the room is 5.0 meters, the width is 3.0 meters, and the height is 2.5 meters, then the volume of the room is: Volume = 5.0 m  3.0 m  2.5 m = 37.5 m3 Q: What is the volume of the dinosaur in the diagram above? A: The volume of the water alone is 4.8 mL. The volume of the water and dinosaur together is 5.6 mL. Therefore, the volume of the dinosaur alone is 5.6 mL - 4.8 mL = 0.8 mL.

2485,"Context: When you add sugar to a cold drink, you may stir it to help the sugar dissolve. If you dont stir, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. Stirring is one of several factors that affect how fast a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. For example, sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the same amount of sugar in a cube. Thats because granulated sugar has much more surface area than a cube of sugar. You can see videos of all three factors at these URLs: MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below.

Question: less sugar can dissolve in cold water than in hot water.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",A
2486,"Context: Certain factors can change the solubility of a solute. Temperature is one such factor. How temperature affects solubility depends on the state of the solute, as you can see in the Figure 1.1. If a solute is a solid or liquid, increasing the temperature increases its solubility. For example, more sugar can dissolve in hot water than in cold water. If a solute is a gas, increasing the temperature decreases its solubility. For example, less carbon dioxide can dissolve in warm water than in cold water. The solubility of gases is also affected by pressure. Pressure is the force pushing against a given area. Increasing the pressure on a gas increases its solubility. Did you ever open a can of soda and notice how it fizzes out of the can? Soda contains dissolved carbon dioxide. Opening the can reduces the pressure on the gas in solution, so it is less soluble. As a result, some of the carbon dioxide comes out of solution and rushes into the air. Q: Which do you think will fizz more when you open it, a can of warm soda or a can of cold soda? A: A can of warm soda will fizz more because increasing the temperature decreases the solubility of a gas. Therefore, less carbon dioxide can remain dissolved in warm soda than in cold soda.

Question: a solution is any mixture of two or more substances.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
2503,"Context: All solutions have two parts: the solute and the solvent. The solute is the substance that dissolves, and the solvent is the substance that dissolves the solute. Particles of solvent pull apart particles of solute, and the solute particles spread throughout the solvent. Salt water, such as the ocean water in the Figure 1.1, is an example of a solution. In a saltwater solution, salt is the solute and water is the solvent. Q: A scientist obtained a sample of water from the Atlantic Ocean and determined that the sample was about 3.5 percent dissolved salt. Predict the percent of dissolved salt in a sample of water from the Pacific Ocean. A: As a solution, ocean water is a homogeneous mixture. Therefore, no matter where the water sample is obtained, its composition will be about 3.5 percent dissolved salt. 
Question: dissolved particles in a solution
Options:(A) are too small to be seen (B) will settle out of the solution (C) will rise to the top of the solution (D) two of the above
Answer:",A
2504,"Context: Like salt water in the ocean, many solutions are normally in the liquid state. However, matter in any state can form a solution. An alloy, which is a mixture of a metal with one or more other substances, is a solid solution at room temperature. For example, the alloy bronze is a solution of copper and tin. Matter in the gaseous state can also form solutions. Q: What is an example of a gaseous solution? A: Air in the atmosphere is a gaseous solution. It is a mixture that contains mainly nitrogen and oxygen gases, with very small amounts of several other gases. The circle graph in the Figure 1.3 shows the composition of air. Oil from an oil spill floats on ocean water. Because air is a solution, it is homogeneous. In other words, no matter where you go, the air always contains the same proportion of gases that are shown in the graph. 
Question: only liquids can form solutions.
Options:(A) true (B) false
Answer:",B
2505,"Context: In the example of bronze, a solid (tin) is dissolved in another solid (copper). However, matter in any state can be the solute or solvent in a solution. For example, in a saltwater solution, a solid (salt) is dissolved in a liquid (water). The Table 1.1 describes examples of solutions consisting of solutes and solvents in various states of matter. Type of Solution: Example Gas dissolved in gas: dry air Gas dissolved in liquid: carbonated water Liquid dissolved in gas: moist air Liquid dissolved in liquid: vinegar Solid dissolved in liquid: sweet tea Solute oxygen carbon dioxide Solvent nitrogen water water acetic acid sugar air water tea

2506,"Context: Not only salt, but many other solutes can dissolve in water. In fact, so many solutes can dissolve in water that water has been called the universal solvent. Even rocks can dissolve in water, which explains the cave that opened this article. A solute that can dissolve in a given solvent, such as water, is said to be soluble in that solvent. Conversely, a solute that cannot dissolve in a given solvent is said to be insoluble in that solvent. Although most solutes can dissolve in water, some solutes are insoluble in water. Oil is an example. Did you ever try to mix oil with water? No matter how well you mix the oil into the water, after the mixture stands for a while, the oil separates from the water and rises to the top. You can see how oil floats on ocean water in the Figure 1.2.

2513,"Context: Water is the most common substance on Earth, and most of it exists in the liquid state. A liquid is one of four well-known states of matter, along with solid, gas, and plasma states. The particles of liquids are in close contact with each other but not as tightly packed as the particles in solids. The particles can slip past one another and take the shape of their container. However, they cannot pull apart and spread out to take the volume of their container, as particles of a gas can. If the volume of a liquid is less than the volume of its container, the top surface of the liquid will be exposed to the air, like the vinegar in the bottle pictured in the Figure 1.1. Q: Why does most water on Earths surface exist in a liquid state? In what other states does water exist on Earth? A: Almost 97 percent of water on Earths surface is found as liquid salt water in the oceans. The temperature over most of Earths surface is above the freezing point (0 C) of water, so relatively little water exists as ice. Even near the poles, most of the water in the oceans is above the freezing point. And in very few places on Earths surface do temperatures reach the boiling point (100 C) of water. Although water exists in the atmosphere in a gaseous state, water vapor makes up less than 1 percent of Earths total water.

Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Properties of matter in different states. Q: The Figure 1.2 shows that a liquid takes the shape of its container. How could you demonstrate this? A: You could put the same volume of liquid in containers with different shapes. This is illustrated below with a beaker (left) and a graduated cylinder (right). The shape of the liquid in the beaker is short and wide like the beaker, while the shape of the liquid in the graduated cylinder is tall and narrow like that container, but each container holds the same volume of liquid. Q: How could you show that a gas spreads out to take the volume as well as the shape of its container? A: You could pump air into a bicycle tire. The tire would become firm all over as air molecules spread out to take the shape of the tire and also to occupy the entire volume of the tire.

2516,"Context: Energy is always involved in changes of state. Matter either loses or absorbs energy when it changes from one state to another. For example, when matter changes from a liquid to a solid, it loses energy. The opposite happens when matter changes from a solid to a liquid. For a solid to change to a liquid, matter must absorb energy from its surroundings. The amount of energy in matter can be measured with a thermometer. Thats because a thermometer measures temperature, and temperature is the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter.
